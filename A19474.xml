            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I may be bold to looke ſo high, I dare looke no higher than your ſelues in this my dedication. Were I able to bring forth a birth worthy of a higher countenance, to whom ſhould I offer it but vnto my <hi>Lords Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> from whom I haue receiued all my worldly mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, vnder whom I doe enioy all my beſt earthly countenance, and at whoſe lips I haue
<pb facs="tcp:479:4"/> receiued ſuch moſt fatherly incouragements (both to take heed to reading, and to doctrine, and alſo to pray to God morning and euening, that <hi>God may be my God when I least dreame of him</hi>) as I hope I ſhall neuer be backward to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, alwaies ready to make vſe of, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement of thoſe ſpirituall graces, wherewith through Gods gracious gift, I came into this Country. But I neuer yet could ſo ouerweene my owne abilities, as to thinke their fruit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of ſuch a patronage. If I ſeeme not too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous in what I doe, (I hope) I neuer ſhall in what I might doe. It is my ioy and my reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that within mine owne circle God hath raiſed me vp ſuch friends, as will not eaſily take in ill part my louing rudeneſſe towards them. Some few yeeres experience makes this good of your worthy ſelues, who haue ſo faithfully ſhewed your ſelues friends, ſo cheerefully audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſo patiently giuen me leaue, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately to ſtirre vp your willing minds, that I cannot entertaine the leaſt doubt of your kinde embracings of this poore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of my thankfulneſſe vnto you. I remember what <hi>Socrates</hi> did reply to <hi>Aeſchines</hi> his ſcholler, when being poore he tooke it to heart that he was not able to gratifie him, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb facs="tcp:479:4"/> as others did:<note place="margin">Annon intelligis quàm magnum munus mihi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſti? niſi fortè teipſum parvi aeſtimas.</note> 
               <hi>Doest thou not know</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates) how great a gift thou hast giuen me? belike thou accountest thy ſelfe little worth.</hi> Implying that he accounted his gift (though poore) more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than theirs who were rich; becauſe they had giuen him of theirs, he had giuen him himſelfe. Right thus doe I iudge the caſe to be betweene your Worſhips and my ſelfe: It may trouble me that I haue no better to giue, but I know it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents you that I giue my ſelfe, to wit, my preſence to your perſons, my prayers for your eſtates, and my vttermoſt abilities in the execution of my weake miniſterie for the eternall good of your, with all my deare peoples, ſoules. A taſte of this I offer vnto you in theſe two Sermons, which were firſt made publike at two Aſſizes by the ioynt requeſt of you both: next are made pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like in Print by mine owne offer, &amp; deſire of the good of Gods Church. God giue them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the eies of his people. I doe not looke that they ſhould finde a like entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all. My aime is to warme the hearts of my deare Countrymen: whereto if the force of my poore ſparke will not extend, my neerer aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to doe good vnto my flocke: which yet if I cannot reach, my neereſt aime is to ſhew my ſelfe thankfull vnto you both; and aboue all to
<pb facs="tcp:479:5"/> ſet forth the honour of God in awaking conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wooing and winning deſires to this his true Church. Buſie are the aduerſaries of our common mother (the Church of <hi>England</hi>) to gaine appetites and affections to <hi>Rome.</hi> Many words are thought too few, much eloquence too little, and the rowling of all ſtones not enough to this end. If therefore <hi>Croeſus</hi> his dumbe ſonne could ſpeake when he ſaw one offering violence to his father,<note place="margin">Homo, ne interſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias Croeſum.</note> ſaying, <hi>O man, kill not Croeſus:</hi> then no maruell if we, that are ſpeaking ſonnes of our deare Mother, doe plead her cauſe, and redeeme her credit from the ſlander of ſtrangers, yea of her vnnaturall children. It was a militarie law of old, that the ſouldiers who had not killed an enemie ſhould not be girded with a girdle but with an halter: and ſurely me thinks the law were good to be executed vpon them who haue not maintained the Church their mother as they are able. To auoid this cenſure I haue done my beſt, as I could, in a word: and if I meet with a heauier cenſure for doing what I haue, than if I had done nothing; my comfort is that I haue vſed my talent with an honeſt heart; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am not altogether out of hope, that I may be a little blaſt in Gods mouth, a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Man of Sinne in them that cannot
<pb facs="tcp:479:5"/> ſearch either more large or learned bookes. There is but one thing aboue the reſt which breedeth preiudice in mens minds, and keeps them from making vſe of our writings: and that is this, A politike perſwaſion by cunning leaders, that we preach a new doctrine, and walke not in the traces of our forefathers. But if either of theſe could be iuſtly faſtned vpon vs, we ſhould hate our ſelues, our doctrine, our courſe. As for our doctrine, we heartily confeſſe that it is impoſſible that ſauing truth ſhould be kept vp in a corner and not diſcloſed till latter dayes. It neither ſtands with Gods loue, who willeth that <hi>all men ſhould be ſaued and come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> nor with his truth, who hath promiſed to leade his Church, (ſo long as it is ſo) not by diuine vnction only, as others ſay, but by ordinarie meanes, into all ſupernaturall truths. Therefore as our bleſſed Sauiour put his doctrine vpon this triall, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo;</hi> euen ſo doe we. It is true, that truth muſt ſtand though it haue no outward thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, euen <hi>naked truth.</hi> When therefore we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the times before,<note place="margin">Veritati credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, non quia cana, ſed quia ſana.</note> we doe it not as if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie could make a truth, or as if we had no other cauſe to embrace it; for the Deuill was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, though God was before him;
<pb facs="tcp:479:6"/> (In which reſpect as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſaid to one who bragged of his ſwimming, <hi>Art not thou aſhamed to boast of that which euery ſprat can doe?</hi> ſo may we anſwer the great braggers of Antiquitie, that they may be aſhamed to boaſt of that which the Deuils may claime as well as they) but we doe it as outwardly commending that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready truth vnto vs. Now becauſe our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tell vs that the truth we boaſt of hath not this badge, but is of yeſterday of <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins</hi> hatching; I humbly beſeech you but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> into three points: Firſt, whether that which is new be alwaies to be reiected?<note place="margin">Vide Muſc. h. comm.</note> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirme it, becauſe it is not euill in it ſelfe, and in it owne nature: for who deſires not a new houſe rather than an old, and a new gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather than one conſumed with age? I know there is difference betweene earthly and heauenly things, but euen in theſe things new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it ſelfe is not to be diſallowed. For Chriſt compares his doctrine to <hi>new wine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth 9.</note> and ſaith, <hi>A new commandement giue I vnto you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> and giueth a <hi>new teſtament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> whereof the cup in the Sacrament is a ſigne and ſeale. It remaineth then that we doe diſtinguiſh of <hi>newneſſe,</hi> and finde out two kindes of it: The firſt we may call curſed <hi>Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> when, by intruſion of errour to thoſe that are
<pb facs="tcp:479:6"/> in the right way, truth and goodneſſe are iuſtled out of the way:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> as when the Iewes brought in new and ſtrange gods which their fathers knew not, the falſe Apoſtles another Goſpell,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.6.</note> and the like. The ſecond wee may call gracious <hi>newneſſe,</hi> when diuine truth is brought in to thoſe that are in ſinne and errour.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> Thus thoſe that are in the old leauen of ſinne are prouoked to newneſſe;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. Eph. 4. Col. 3. Mar. 1.27. Act. 17.19.</note> and our fathers who were in the old way of errour had the new doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached vnto them. Secondly, put caſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that that which is new is alwaies reproueable;<note place="margin">Illud novum eſt quod antea nec fuit unquam, nec viſum eſt, nec au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum hactenus, ſed jam primùm coepit, &amp; in lucem emerſit.</note> is <hi>the truth in our Church new?</hi> No ſurely: that did not then begin to be, when the freſh preaching of it was renewed. For it is that which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles, haue taught and beleeued; and from thence we fetch it. We carry it along in that little flocke of all times, who, according to the meaſure of meanes which God vouchſafed, haue kept their garments in the midſt of Popiſh tyrannie, and at the length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much corruption, contracted through the want of watchfulneſſe in a ſecure &amp; proſperous eſtate, we preſent it vnto the Church againe in that bleſſed manner wherein we now enioy it. As the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not new when it was publiſhed vnto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the renewed law of
<pb facs="tcp:479:7"/> nature; and the Goſpell was not new, when it was preached by the Apoſtles, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed doctrine of faith: ſo the truth of our Church was not new, when it was publiſhed by <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> and the other Worthies of God; but the renewed truth which appeared more gloriouſly after the deſperate ſickneſſe of errour in the Church vnder the more preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power of Antichriſt. If you ſhall here ſay, that it did appeare new to the wiſe of that age; I yeeld it did ſo to the wiſe men after the fleſh: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but (in the third place) through whoſe default was that? Surely through the default of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled Fathers, who, being ouercome with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious titles, with outward ſplendor, with the myſterie of the abhominations in the golden cup, and with the cuſtome of many yeeres which grew vpon them by degrees like rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the coare of a beautifull apple, thought that our change brought in a noueltie. Hence it came that the ancient Apoſtolique truth was not acknowledged of her children. Euen as if a true mother ſhould be baniſhed from her houſe, and returning after a long ſeaſon ſhould not be knowne of her owne children: So truth, being baniſhed by that vnholy chaire, and falſhood admitted through the neglect of
<pb facs="tcp:479:7"/> our improuident fathers, was ſcarce confeſſed of them that were her children at her returne. Theſe three points being thus conſidered, we ſay,<note place="margin">Act. 24.14.</note> that <hi>after the way which they call hereſie</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, <hi>we worſhip the Lord God of our fathers;</hi> but that our truth and doctrine is noueltie, wee leaue it vnto them that can to proue. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that we take but his libertie, who, being vrged with what a Father thought,<note place="margin">Sed pater patrum Apoſtolus aliter ſenſit.

            <p>Now for the ſecond part of the charge, that we walke not in the traces of our forefathers; may it pleaſe your Worſhips to conſider thus much: Firſt, that we hearken to the voice of God in the Scriptures, which doe blame Gods owne people for ſticking too cloſe vnto the examples of their fathers,<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore wee cheerefully imitate their manifeſt vertues; we doe, in reuerence to their perſons, burie their errors in obliuion; of their doubtfull actions wee doe admit of the moſt fauourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; the blemiſhes of their religion wee waſh from their vnderſtandings, wills, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with remembring their miſerable times wherein the key of knowledge was kept from them, and the blindneſſe of their guides, who kept them in darkneſſe that they might the better make their owne games: and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their eternall eſtate with God, we haue thoughts of comfort, both becauſe their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was ineuitable, as alſo becauſe they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed according to that Chriſtian knowledge which then was attainable, and ſinned not wilfully as we doe againſt that glorious light which God doth now offer in the miniſterie of his moſt holy word. Thirdly, conſidering that our fore-fathers acts are no ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for vs, wee, notwithſtanding our reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto them, dare not ſweare to their ſayings, and admit of a blinde imitation of their actions without triall; but, with a holy anger againſt that curſed apoſtaſie which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our deare predeceſſors, and brought them

I preſuppoſe theſe two propoſitions to be Gods truth. Firſt, that the Churches ſpeciall ſeruants are of Gods ſending. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it is neceſſary that the people, to whom wee preach, ſhould be perſwaded of it. Is not Ieruſalem which is aboue the Mother of vs all? VVhence then ſhould wee expect all her ſeruitours not left free to her ſelfe, but from our fathers appointment? Yet what though we are called by God; will it euer be ſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto vs, if the people to whom we are ſent do not know it? We would willingly that they ſhould heare what we ſpeake in Chriſts ſtead, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God: which yet they can neuer do, except they are perſwaded that wee are ſent of God.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore worth our marking, to ſee how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle labours the perſwaſion of this point: For himſelfe, hee doth ſtill vrge his miſſion; That the Goſpell which he preached was not after men, but that hee was called by God. And for all others, hee calleth them Souldiers, as hauing receiued their preſſe from God; and Miniſters, that all the world may know, that God keepeth the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of his Office in his owne hand, and makes vs his Seruants, yea Cryers, to lend our good will and voyce to his matters to bee publiſhed. No doubt the holy Ghoſt foreſaw the neceſſity of this perſwaſion, not only
<pb facs="tcp:479:12"/> that the miniſtery might haue the greater attention, and reſpect giuen vnto it, but that <hi>Lydeas</hi> heart might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, <hi>Felix</hi> might tremble, the Iewes might be prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their very hearts, and made to crye out; <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall wee doe to be ſaued!</hi> Yea, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of hearers hearts might be made manifeſt, and they may fall downe on their faces, and worſhip God, and ſay plainly; <hi>That God is in you indeed.</hi> Oh that now and euer God would giue vs hearts to liue like thoſe that are ſent.

Oh that I could perſwade you to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them by obſeruing theſe three rules: Firſt, ſtriue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue your ſelues like men of knowledge, by taking heed to doctrine &amp; to reading; they that muſt diuide the word of God aright, and buckle with ſuch curſed wits, as are in many places abroach to defend the waies of ſinne, had neede be more then idle or Idoll Shepheards. They that muſt haue an eye (as far as they can) to diſcerne the ſtate of their flocks, that they may encourage the ſtrong, adde ſtrength to the weake, and defend all (as neare as they can) from the priuy blames of their ſecreteſt aduerſaries, had neede be ſuch Meſſengers, ſuch Interpreters as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme that glorious calling. Indeed,<note place="margin">Vt prodeat, vt appereat os, vt finem faciat.</note> if it would ſuffice a Miniſter, that he come vp into the Pulpit, and ſpeake, and make an end, we might ſoone perſwade our ſelues that we are ſent; but I like <hi>Luthers</hi> iudgment well, who requireth three things in a ſent Preacher; Prayer, Study, and Temptation: The firſt, to preuent and follow ſtudie; the ſecond, to practiſe prayer: and the third, to ſweeten both. Wee muſt pray, that wee may ſtudie profitable things: wee muſt ſtudie, that we may doe anſwerable to our petitions, both towards our ſelues and others: and wee muſt finde by experience in the combats with the power of darkneſſe, that we being tempted againſt both,
<pb facs="tcp:479:13"/> doe fight the good fight of Faith. Now, whether it bee thus with vs, I appeale vnto our ſoules, as in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeke your Maſters honour: He is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, who comes in his owne name; but hee that can ſay with <hi>Iohn Baptist; He muſt encreaſe, I muſt decreaſe,</hi> he is the man that is ſent. How many times doe our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing thoughts hit vs in the teeth with our ſeeking our ſelues? How did that ſpeech become a dying Prel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Modo viuat ac ſtoreat Eccleſia me moriente, ago non curo.</note> 
                     <hi>I care not though I dye?</hi> And how would the ſpeech of <hi>Ecebolius</hi> become vs (in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe) <hi>Trample vpon me vnſauory ſalt, ſo my God may be honoured?</hi> But alaſſe, as a falſe-hearted woer, who is ſent to ſpeake a good word for his Friend, ſpeakes one word for his friend, and two for himſelfe: ſo (I doubt) deale ſome of vs with God. For our Maſters ſake, whoſe Ambaſſadors wee are; for our ſoules ſake, which we do pawne vnto God, thinke ſeriouſly vpon theſe things. And know this for a truth, that by how much more wee make God to appeare in his Treaſure (hiding humane wiſdome, and ſpeaking by power from on high, in eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſpirit) and our ſelues to be but earthen veſſels, by ſo much more we may perſwade our hearts, that wee are ſent of God.</p>
                  <p>If you aske me, what particular direction I propound vnto my ſelfe in ſeeking of my Maſters honour? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Sun is called in Hebrew tongue by three names. The firſt ſignifieth the warme Sunne, becauſe nothing is hid from the heat thereof. The ſecond doth ſignifie the gliſtering Sunne, becauſe it being an excelling ſenſible dazeleth the eies of all beholders. The third ſignifieth a Miniſter or Seruant, becauſe God by it doth miniſter light, heat, and precious fruits to all people vnder heauen. When therefore I doe conſider, that Miniſters are called Starres in Gods right hand; and withall, that this great Starre, which God ſends out of the Chambers of the
<pb facs="tcp:479:13"/> duſt, doth thus declare the glory of its Maker; I thought my ſelfe bound euen ſo to ſeeke the honour of God by the light of Doctrine, by the heat of zeale, and by the fruit of a good life. The ſame direction I commend to you: the light of Doctrine muſt ſhine from you: the heat of zeale muſt ſhew in you: and the fruit of a good life muſt be brought forth by you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, neuer forget that you are charged before God, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall iudge both quicke and dead, to be inſtant in preaching the word: So that if the dignity of your Flockes, who are co-heires with Chriſt; or the price of their redemption which is the blood of Ieſus; or the hungring of their ſoules for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall food, doe not mooue you to powerfulneſſe, yet let Gods forenamed charge.<note place="margin">O vtinam tam vigiles reperiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad curam, quam alacres currunt ad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedram.</note> I know that <hi>Bernards</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint may fitly take place; <hi>Oh that men were as watchfull to diſcharge their Cures, as they are cheerefull to runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Chaires!</hi> But, though Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Iudah ſinne; though others be careleſſe, yet be it far from you, euen from your thoughts and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Is it difficult? be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Ieſus, and not in your ſelues. Doth it exhauſt your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? care not to ſacrifice your ſelues in the ſeruice of the Church, ſo your God may haue honour, and his people edification.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what Chriſt ſaith to the Angell of <hi>Laode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea; Be zealous and amend:</hi> that would I ſay to you. For what more needefull? We dwell like men vnder the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged zone, our Pariſhes Friezeland, our people frozen into the mud of the world, and dregges of ſinne; and will not you be hiſſing hot in ſpirit? When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the Idolatrie of Athens, his ſpirit was ſtirred within him: and ſhall we haue no pietie to God, no pitty to men? Our words in our owne caſes manifeſt heat;<note place="margin">Caro ſuſcepit dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma perdidit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtatem.</note> and ſhall we be in Gods key cold? Ah, let it not be ſaid, <hi>That the Fleſh hath wonne honour, and the Spirit hath loſt honeſty.</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:479:14"/> adde no more to this, but theſe few words; Let vs take heed, leſt as luke-warme creatures, God doe ſpue vs out of his mouth, as a diſhonourable burthen.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt, be carefull for a good life. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith; that, <hi>Speech without life is not Gods.</hi> I will not ſay ſo, I know that God may ſpeake out of a buſh that is good for nothing but burning: Yet this I ſay concerning him who honoureth not his Maſter with the fruit of a good life, that I doubt whether he can aſſure himſelfe that he is of Gods ſending, when as his ſteps lead towards hell, though his finger point towards heauen. How frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth God preſſe the good life of a Preacher? Yea, I remember the godly care which the great Synderion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Iewes had to this purpoſe: They ſate in a Chamber of the Temple, to trye and iudge the Prieſts, both for their Genealogies, and blemiſhes: by whom whatſoeuer Prieſt was found diſallowable, was cloathed in black, and ſo went out of the Prieſts Court; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was found perfect and fit, was clothed in white, and accounted worthy. To what end ſhould the care of God and man concurre in this, if it were not neceſſary? You haue learned how to apply deeper things: I will therefore end this rule, with that ſpeech of <hi>Ierome</hi> to <hi>Nepotian;</hi>

                  <p>The laſt rule which I would commend vnto you to be obſerued, that you may proue your ſelues to bee ſent of God, is, to be in a readineſſe to giue your Maſter an account of your ſeruice: For this is an argument of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and faithfulneſſe of a diuine Sender, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſends can try the heart and reines.</p>
                  <p>Put caſe therefore that now yee heard that voice of
<pb facs="tcp:479:14"/> God; <hi>Ariſe ye dead and come to iudgement:</hi> that now the earth did vomit vp her dead; that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood vp with his conuerted Iewes, and <hi>Paul</hi> with his Gentiles; that <hi>Iohn</hi> came in with <hi>Aſia, Thomas India,</hi> and <hi>Titus Creta,</hi> What would ye doe? What would ye do, I ſay? Could ye ſay, Lord, I tooke thy perſon vpon me, to feed thy Sheep, of conſcience, not of couetouſneſſe, to build vp thy kingdome, not to inlarge my owne praiſe and purſe: I haue walked before thee with an vpright heart in the middeſt of thine houſe; and now (Lord) behold I am ready to giue thee an account of my ſinceritie, though not of my perfection? If it be thus (my Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and beloued Brethren) giue me your hands, and let vs with comforts goe together and trade into heauen by prayer, ſtudie, and meditation for the beſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that in Gods ſtead we may enrich his people, and preſent ſuch as belong to him as chaſt Virgins to God in the day of Chriſt.

                  <p>We haue to doe, you ſee, with the ſecond diſcouery of DAVIDS deuotion, that is, his admiration, ſecretly implied in the frame of his whole ſpeech. Wherein by the heauenly diſpoſition of his deſires, hee doth ſhew his dependance vpon God in his ordinarie courſe of offering grace. For whereas the ſoules of men are conſidered, either according to their vnderſtandings, or according to their deſires and appetites reaſonable &amp; ſenſitiue: DAVID hauing exerciſed his vnderſtanding in the beholding of God, as he was to him, and as he would be to his enemies, doth here exerciſe his deſires to Gods houſe. Touching which deſires theſe three things offer themſelues to our conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The office of his deſires: which is ſhewed in two things:</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The obiect of his deſires <hi>[The houſe of God.]</hi> There was nothing after which his heart panted more eagerly than Gods houſe.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, for the limiting of our deſires,<note place="margin">Three rules to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note> let vs write in our hearts theſe three rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in worldly things let vs only deſire neceſſaries: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for if we deſire neuer ſo much, there is to be found at the leaſt a double defect in the things deſired. Firſt, there is no <hi>Sufficiencie</hi> in them: for all the world is too little for our appetites; they being like fire, on which the more wood is laid, the higher the flame riſeth. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof is this; becauſe our ſoules were made for God: as therefore no man can fill a cheſt or bagge with learning, becauſe they were not made for it; ſo none can
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:479:18"/> fill their deſires with the world, becauſe they were made for God. Secondly, there is no <hi>Perpetuitie</hi> in them: for either we are taken from them, as it is ſaid to the rich foole in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> 
                     <hi>O foole, this night ſhall thy ſoule be taken from thee;</hi> or elſe they are taken from vs, both when they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in themſelues by their corruptible nature, as the rich mans gold in his cheſt and fold in his field;<note place="margin">Iames 5.</note> as alſo when they periſh to vs,<note place="margin">Iob 1.</note> as <hi>Iobs</hi> ſubſtance by theeues and windes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in wicked things let vs deſire to be freed from all them in all vs: for as that God who ſeparates vs from the world to him is holy,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.11.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſingeth, <hi>Who is like vnto thee among the gods? who is like vnto thee ſo glorious in holineſſe?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.7.</note> So <hi>we are called not vnto vncleanneſſe, but vnto holineſſe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> and <hi>God doth dwell and walke amongst vs.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Deut. 23.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy campe, therefore thine hoast ſhall be holy:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that he may make the deeper impreſſion, he giues the law of the paddle ſtaffe to couer their excrements. Yea as God is holy, and we are called vnto holineſſe, and the holy God doth dwell amongſt vs, ſo to make our thirſt to be freed from ſinne the greater, let vs deeply apprehend that ſinne is more hurtfull vnto vs than the Deuill. Were it not for ſinne the Deuill could doe vs no more hurt than he did to Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5.</note> when he tempted him. We may be <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer to Satan,</hi> and be the better for it; but if we be deliuered ouer to ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note> there is no wickedneſſe ſo great, which we will not runne into to ripen our damnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in good things let our deſires be infinitely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after them:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Satietas in ſacris nè ſit: erit.</hi> Two motiues to ſtirre vs vp to rule our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note> for this is the meaſure of our deſires in theſe things, to couet them aboue meaſure. At which height that wee may aime, let vs but commend vnto our hearts, &amp; craue from God a bleſſing vpon theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:479:18"/>
                  <p>Firſt, that vnruly deſires doe further diſcomfort much; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and that two waies. Firſt, by hurting of grace: for they choake it,<note place="margin">Marke 4.19.</note> as Chriſt ſaith of the luſting after the profits and pleaſures of this world, that they are as thornes. If inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire after other things, doth hinder our worldly thriuing (it carrying our mindes from our imployments) then much more the thriuing and well liking of our ſoules in grace and godlineſſe. Secondly, by helping ſinne: for as they doe incline the will, and make the whole man more apt for execution, (in which reſpect our deſires may well be ſaid to adde wings vnto our ſoules;) ſo they doe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the vnderſtanding, and make it ſottiſh in ſpirituall things: for though there be firſt darkneſſe in our thoughts, and enmitie in our wiſdomes,<note place="margin">Heſter 1.</note> yet as <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> doth firſt draw his Courtiers vnto wickedneſſe, and then his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers doe make him worſe by flattery and other ſiniſter meanes: ſo the vnderſtanding doth firſt ſurrender vp her naturall powers and offices, being content to be blinded and miſlead, and that way be giuen to the will and deſires to inthrone the Deuill, and then the will and deſires doe more infatuate the minde, the belly fighting with the braine, and miſleading it being blinded to the ruine of the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider that vnruly deſires doe hinder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The greateſt comforts which wee reape from our ſelues, are our deſires. Good deſires are the glory of a good mans ſoule; what is a godly man, but a man of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires?<note place="margin">Chriſtianus eſt in fieri non in facto.</note> A Chriſtian is what he hopes to be (and therefore deſires it) rather than what he is by preſent practiſe. What is the good mans faith? Oh that I had Chriſt: no doubt DAVIDS heart was not without a myſtery, when he was ſo eagerly carried after the water of the well of Bethlehem: and this is the myſterie of faith in our hearts, which is more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:479:19"/> eagerly carried after Chriſt with deſires, than with full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.5.</note> And what is the good mans obedience? <hi>Oh that my waies were ſo direct, that I might keepe thy ſtatutes!</hi> As therefore if wee had but one worldly thing whence wee might reape comfort, we would make much of that; ſo let vs deale by our deſires, make we them as pretious as we can in Chriſt Ieſus, that God may accept the will for the deed.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that that curſed fleſh which is in our boſomes, preuaileth againſt vs much: but bleſſed ſhall we be, if our eares hearken in time to the wholeſome counſell following. <q rend="inline">Wee reade of the Lake of <hi>Armach</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it hath this propertie; If you thruſt a ſtaffe into the bottome of it, that part which is in the mudde is turned into iron, and that which is in the water is turned into a whetſtone.</q> Like vnto this ſtaffe is the fleſh and ſpirit of man in the Lake of this life. The fleſh which carrieth a mans deſires to digge in the mudde of this world, is turned as it were into iron, (and therefore it is no maruell if it preuaile againſt our frailtie:) but the ſpirit (which, at the worſt, deſcends no lower than to the troubleſome billowes of this world) is as it were, turned into a whetſtone: this muſt be broke off, and not only ſcoure the ruſt of the fleſh, but euen conſume it, that ſo at the laſt wee may haue our deſires at command, as DAVID. Happie ſhall wee be, if by being ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, we ſhall make our deſires to be like that liuing herbe called <hi>Sentida,</hi> of which they write thus; <q rend="inline">That if a man doe but offer to touch it, it withdraweth the leaues, and if hee touch it indeed, it drieth vp and withereth, which yet ſo ſoone as the hand is withdrawne flouriſheth againe:</q> happie (I ſay) ſhall we be, if thus, ſo ſoone as any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe or wickedneſſe doe but offer to approach, we draw
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:479:19"/> our deſires away by a ſigh to heauen; if it take poſſeſſion, we droope and die within our ſelues, and neuer be at reſt and flouriſh till it be gone againe.</p>
                  <p>Thus we haue viewed the choice of the Good-mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we will further view them in their Conſtancie.<note place="margin">Conſtancie.</note> The wickedeſt man amongſt vs may ſay: If this be ſo pretious a thing to reſerue and limit my deſires, as DAVID did to this <hi>(one thing)</hi> then I am ſure enough of my hand: for euen I <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would haue pleaded an ill cauſe, and pronounced an vnrighteous ſentence,<note place="margin">Numb. 23.10.</note> in curſing them whom God had bleſſed, and bleſſing them whom God had curſed,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.34.</note> haue reſerued my deſires for <hi>the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> and I <hi>Eſau,</hi> who haue ſet more by earth than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, haue reſerued my deſires for my Fathers Propheticall bleſſing. But DAVID takes vp the matter, and telleth vs, that as it is the office of the good mans deſire to make choice, ſo to be conſtant in their choice, and to like the good obiect whereat it lookes too well to change: <hi>What I haue deſired, that will I ſeeke.</hi> Hence carry this point with you, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gracious deſire is not ſatisfied, till the partie deſiring doe embrace the thing deſired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yee know how it was with DAVID, when he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to finde out a place for the Arke, that ſigne of Gods preſence, he had no reſt till he had done it; he would not come into the Tabernacle of his houſe, nor come vpon his pallet or bed, he would not ſuffer his eyes to ſleepe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.3, 4.</note> nor his eye-lids to ſlumber, till he had found out a place for it. Euen ſo is it with al Gods people, in proſecuting of al good deſires: they are ſicke and their ſoules faint within them, till they haue brought them to ſome good paſſe. See it in Chriſts Spouſe in the Canticles:<note place="margin">Cant. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> ſhee deſired communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt; wherefore ſhee gaue her ſelfe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:479:20"/> no reſt in her bed by night, ſhe ſought him whom her ſoule loued, and though ſhe found him not, yet ſhe aroſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to ſeeke him ſtill: when ſhe could not enioy her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired content by her owne induſtrie, ſhe runnes to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word, the Watch-men: thus ſhe is like the Turtle that mournes her ſelfe to death, if ſhe cannot finde her mate.</p>
                  <p>To open this more diſtinctly; the vnweariedneſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires is ſeene in three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they conſume all difficulties for Gods ſake: let a man deſire any thing that good is, he ſhal finde ſuch pailes of water as theſe are to be throwne into this fire: why ſhould I deſire this, ſeeing it croſſeth my profit; pleaſure, eaſe, or ſeeing I hauing obtained it, ſhall be expoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and contempt? But grace conſumes all this, and makes a man ſay with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Should ſuch a man as I feare? and this not out of ſelfe-loue, vaine-glory, checke of conſcience, but for God and goodneſſe ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they are fixed vpon the thing deſired, and preſſe vpon the ſuperiour faculties of the ſoule to know it better, to approue it, and neuer to forget it, though not to be enioyed, but after long time and many conflicts. So that as deſires make a man neuer to ſtand vpon difficulties, as I ſaid before, and as we ſee in the ſouldier, who through deſire of victory and prey, ſtandeth not vpon the hazard of his life: ſo they faſten the eye of the ſoule with intention vpon the thing deſired, as the deſires of the louer capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uates the blinded minde to admire, to inuent praiſes, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and often to thinke vpon, and the will and affections to rowle themſelues, and to doat vpon the partie loued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they are practicall for the obtaining of what they deſire. Thoſe deſires that are not practicall, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh without endeuours to bring them to perfection, neuer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:479:20"/> poſſeſſed the ſoule, wherein they were, for good, as wee may ſee in <hi>Balaam:</hi> for good deſires looke to the meanes, and will doe any thing to accompliſh them, and not reſt vntill in ſome meaſure they haue embraced the deſired good.</p>
                  <p>Now call ouer what hath beene ſaid, againe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> concerning this conſtancie and practicall diſpoſition of gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and compare it with ours: I warrant you it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnto vs the vanitie of our deſires, which goe vnder the name of good, and yet are blaſted before perfected, and doe end in ſhadowes.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more comfortable vnto vs, than to be brought within the compaſſe of the couenant of grace:<note place="margin">A poſteriori.</note> we know that none can conclude their intereſt in it, but ſuch as haue faith and repentance. When we fall to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe things, we comfort our ſelues with this, That <hi>they are bleſſed who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> for we, by the power of our conſciences aſſuming that we are as hungrie after them, as DAVID and his ſouldiers, when they eat the Shew-bread, and as thirſtie as <hi>Sampſon</hi> after his fight, who cried out, <hi>Giue me water, I die for thirſt;</hi> doe conclude that we haue faith and repentance. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we doe reſt vpon our deſires, is it not fit that wee ſhould trie them? Yes ſurely, Lay then then to DAVIDS, and we ſhall finde that his were officiouſly conſtant, and ours are negligently fickle. Doe wee deſire faith? If our deſires be gracious, we will not only doe it for a fit (as a jade will goe vpon ſpeed for a plunge) but, as a woman is at deaths doore till ſhe haue her longing, we will be heart-ſicke till we haue it. Oh how we pant to God, <hi>Lord that I may beleeue, Lord increaſe my faith:</hi> How doe wee preſſe vpon the meanes, and will neuer giue reſt till we finde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dwelling in our hearts by faith, there killing ſin,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:479:21"/> and quickening grace. Doe we deſire repentance? If our deſires be gracious, we will neuer reſt till in ſome meaſure we finde it: yea when we enioy it in a leſſe meaſure, we will not ſuffer our ſelues to be at peace till we finde it in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yea wee will feare alwaies leſt wee haue not repented enough, and therefore we will rowle our repentance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and renew it daily. Thus ſhould our deſires be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and as heauie things doe naturally tend downeward to the Center,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> ſo ſhould our deſires tend to practiſe and perfection. <q rend="inline">But as one doth write of young <hi>Marius,</hi> that by reaſon of the ſtoutneſſe of his talke and geſture, hee obtained to be called the ſonne of <hi>Mars,</hi>
                     </q> but when hee came to proofe hee gained a new name, and was called the ſonne of <hi>Venus:</hi> ſo may wee write of our deſires, that by our words they appeare gracious, but by our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are led by our ſoules, which liue in our ſenſes, to be too baſely effeminate and fickle. As we are wiſe-hearted Chriſtians, let vs be carefull not to be deceiued in them. To this end let vs neuer forget their offices both for choice and conſtancie, that when they are brought vnto their triall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeat of God, we may pleade, <hi>Lord,</hi> we haue carried and ſpent our deſires according to thine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thus we paſſe from their office to their obiect, as it is ſet downe in this place, namely, <hi>(the houſe of God:)</hi> which is to be conſidered two waies:
<list>
                        <item>1. In the type, that is, as that place which God did then ordinarily allow for his publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</item>
                        <item>2. In the truth, that is, as the true Church of God, the body of Chriſt, whereof this houſe of God, whereof DAVID ſpeakes in this place, was but a ſhadow.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:479:21"/>
                  <p>If we conſider it as the Tabernacle which was the place whither the Saints of God did aſſemble for the publike worſhip and ſeruice of God, then, in the obiect of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDS deſires, I would haue you to obſerue this point, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The godly mans heart is caried after nothing more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than after the houſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had a prouerbe, <hi>Bleſſed is he that dusteth himſelfe in the dust of the Temple:</hi> by which out of the height of their deſires they bare witneſſe to DAVIDS ſpeech, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe:</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 122.1.</note> It is true indeed that DAVID did earneſtly deſire life at Gods hand, when hee ſaith, <hi>Returne, O Lord, deliuer my ſoule:</hi> But why was it? <hi>For in death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no remembrance of thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>in the graue who ſhall praiſe thee?</hi> Marke I pray; that which ſet DAVIDS deſire on float, was not the kingdomes and glories of the world, but that hee might praiſe God after the manner of the liuing, with them that keepe holy day. He doth as it were ſet his owne glory vpon one hand, and the worſhip of God in the aſſembly of the Saints on the other; and his heart was more violently carried after this than after that. Thus alſo was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> though he <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt;</hi> yet when he ſaw his place in the houſe of God, and the vſe which the Church would haue of him, he knew not what to <hi>chooſe.</hi>

                     <hi>This is Gods hill in which it pleaſeth him to dwell. God loueth the gates of Zion aboue all the dwellings of Iacob.</hi> And ſhall not we loue his Church?

Here, euen here in the aſſembly of the Saints, God giues his beloued meat and drinke, with other neceſſarie refreſhments for their ſoules. The whole Church of God may be compared to an houſe where there are places of repaſt, and places of lodging: the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:479:22"/> may be compared to the Hall where all Gods ſeruants meet together in ſeuerall aſſemblies for their ſpirituall food; the Church triumphant to the lodgings where they reſt from their labours. As therefore we doe diſcouer our naturall appetite to meat, drinke, and cloathing, without which we cannot liue; ſo ſhould we diſcouer the health of our ſoules by a ſpirituall appetite to the refreſhments of Gods houſe, without which we cannot liue happily.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that our frequent aſſemblings to Gods houſe in many places were enough to make vs iudge that we doe vehemently affect it: but all is not gold that gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

                  <p>Therefore in the feare of God hearken what I ſhall ſay. <q rend="inline">Some Heralds tell vs that none ought to beare gold yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour in Armes but Emperors and Kings, and ſuch as be of the Bloud Royall.</q> Oh that none would beare the glittering ſhew of profeſſion and holineſſe, but thoſe that are of the race of Ieſus Chriſt the King of Kings! then ſhould we not be as the Prieſts, Prince, and people of Iſrael, a ſnare in <hi>Mizpeh</hi> to the ſimple, and a net ſpread on Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> to catch them that know vs not with an opinion of good men and women, faithfull companions, and deare friends, when nothing leſſe.</p>

His heart was alwaies there: not ſo much through the loue of the outward fabricke, though neuer ſo glorious, as for the preſence there, and the duties performed.

                     <hi>O Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Marke here two words; firſt he ſaith, that the tabernacles of God are amiable: That is amiable which hath worth in it ſelfe to draw our loue. Loue is in the louer, and not in things loued, it being wrought in vs and beſtowed vpon other things vpon our weake apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and opinions: but this amiableneſſe is in the thing it ſelfe whereto we looke, which hauing worth doth draw our deſires and affections after it. Secondly hee ſaith, <hi>How amiable!</hi> whereby he doth imply a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation which he doth make with his owne ſoule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excellency of the houſe of God, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that it is ſo excellent that he cannot expreſſe it. But what was this beauty that ſet on fire <hi>Dauids</hi> deſires? Truly, there were many excellent rudiments both in the Tabernacle and in the things contained in them pointing at and teaching Chriſt to come, in which there could not but be matter of much beauty: yet this was not all, nor it may be the principall that <hi>Dauid</hi> meanes: For though (no doubt) he was an excellent Maſter of Ceremonies, both for ſigne and ſenſe, yet theſe were not they that hee beheld (for euen Kings came but to the outer Court) and the beauty of that ſtood in the common ſacrifices, the word, prayer, and praiſe, by the ſinging voices of men well ordered. You will ſay, what beauty was there in the killing and burning of an oxe? Surely none in it ſelfe, but as it was the ordinance of God, ſhewing both our guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and lying in our owne goare, and alſo Ieſus Chriſt dying to acquit vs. What beauty is there in hauing the Word of God read and expounded by a weake earthen veſſell? Nothing in it ſelfe, but as it is the ordinance of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:479:24"/> God for the diſcouering of God, ſeeing of ſinne, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſoules, mortifying of luſts, and putting of life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace. What beauty is there in hearing a man of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted lips to pray, or in praying with him, yea though his tongue be the pen of a ready writer? Truly none in it ſelfe, but as the ſighes and grones of the heart are linked together in loue, to knocke at the gates of heauen to talke with God, to binde and open his hands, to goe into Gods treaſury and fill our ſelues of Gods dainties, or at the leaſt to view them, and by confidence to craue and enjoy them. What beauty is there to heare a company of people to cleere their throats and to chant out a Pſalme or ſong, yea though ſpirituall? None in it ſelfe, but as by the voice the graces of the ſpirit in the heart are exerciſed; as faith in promiſes, feare in threatnings, loue and joy in mercies, humility in arguments of power and the like: When melody is thus made to God in the hid man of the heart, this is beauty indeed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are alſo the beauty of the Lord in our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſaue that now they are more beautifull, becauſe knowledge abounds as the waters of the Sea,<note place="margin">Eſ. 11.</note> in a more plentifull and ſeaſoning manner; as alſo now the ſacrifice is more excellent, being that one, once for all, appearing before God for vs, and preſenting his merits to God, as a perfect and ſufficient attonement, in our behalfe in the higheſt heauens, where is glory for euermore.</p>

It is true that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion met his friends at the three Tauernes, where no doubt there was much paſſage, much people: but ſeldome hath ſome ſauour in it, eſpecially in ſports and recreations, when mirth breeds familiarity, and familiarity contempt.

Secondly, it may bee done by our worldlineſſe. If with <hi>Iudas</hi> we loue the bag better than the Pulpet, and we delight more to prare with them for ours, than to pray with them for themſelues and theirs, we are ſpots and blots in the beautifull aſſembly of the Saints. What beauty is it to ſee thoſe that ſhould liue in Heauen, and draw their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after them, to liue in the holes of the earth like Moles and muck-wormes? Who will beleeue him that ſaith, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is the beſt place in the world, when all his buſineſſe is to make his neſt vpon the earth? I dare not ſay that there ought to be no care for earthly things (for we haue bodies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:479:26"/> that doe depend vpon vs as well as ſoules) but when the thorns do ſo choake the good ſeed in vs, that the beauty of Gods houſe decaieth, then woe vnto vs. Thirdly, it may be done by our wickedneſſe: if the white Nazarites become as blacke as coales, if <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſmooth voice be accompanied with <hi>Eſaus</hi> rough hands, if ſtudies be turned into tap-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and tauernes, and holy tongues which ſhould ſpeake bleſſings, into tongues of wantonneſſe and vanity, how doth the beauty of Gods houſe in vs looke like a ſtinking dunghill to all godly beholders? In the feare of God therefore caſt we theſe filthy coales out of our hands: we haue ſinned againſt Gods beauty too much already, and theſe miſerable times doe call for more beauty in our ſelues, and for more godly care by praying, preaching, and examples, that more of Gods beauty may appeare in thoſe congregations ouer which God hath made vs Shepherds.

                  <p>My ſecond ſuit is, that you would doe your beſt to make the beauty of Gods houſe appeare more beautifull through you. He that ſeeth the worth of a thing thorowly, will doe his beſt to make it appeare the more worthy through him, both in affection, in word, and in action; he will thinke of it more intirely, hee will ſpeake of it with greater praiſes &amp; commendations, and (if it be within his reach, and he be capable) he will doe his beſt to procure it.

You ſhall neuer waſh off this aſperſion, except you enter Duell with that damnable Turke <hi>(Security.)</hi> I might tell you how it lulleth vs aſleepe in a curſed peace, and makes euery one of vs from top to toe neither to minde heauen nor hell: how it makes vs pollute our conſciences, and ſinne againſt them for a friend, for a ſee: how it makes the foundations of the earth to be out of courſe: but I paſſe theſe things, and intreat you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee how it makes vs prophane Gods Sabbaths, &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his ordinances, becauſe it doth blinde vs from ſeeing the beauty of the Lord.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:479:27"/> and our ſoules, let vs fight againſt it by walking as in the ſight and preſence of our God; and as by thinking, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, doing, all things in this meeting, as if the great king of heauen and earth were with vs, in our charge, inquiry, verdict, and ſentence; ſo by humbly crauing at Gods hand, with the blinde man in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord that I may receiue my ſight:</hi> that wee ſeeing Gods beauty may admire it, we admiting it may be moued by it to cleaue to God and his goodneſſe, in the aſſemblie of the Saints.

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.17.</note> For if we muſt heare the word of God not as the word of man, but as it is <hi>indeed the word of God:</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that in the Church onely the fountaine of the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> is opened vnto vs for ſin and for vncleanneſſe:<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, the Church is often compared in the Scripture to the Kingdome of Heauen:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> and that both in reſpect of diſtance, the men of the world being as farre in goodneſſe from the men of the Church, as heauen from earth: and in reſpect of influence, the Church deriuing her miniſteriall helpes to a new generation to all within her reach and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome: as alſo in reſpect of the Churches imployment from God to bee none other but the gate of Heauen (as <hi>Iaacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Bethel</hi>) and a nurſery for the Kingdome of glory.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, it doth attribute that vnto whole Chriſt, which is proper
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:479:30"/> to either nature; ſo we ſay that Chriſt is preſent with vs though his body be in Heauen, becauſe we are not without the bleſſed communion and fellowſhip of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Neither to his ſufficient preſence doe we neede his body now, for though the Kings body bee onely at the Court, yet is he a ſufficient head for gouernement vnder God of his whole Kingdomes as his body politike.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we cannot be ſure (if Chriſt were altogether abſent) that any man in the world, by vertue of any coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuine anointing, is able to ſupply his place. For though as God the Kings and Princes of the earth are his Deputies to ſee his lawes obſerued, and to execute his iudgements, becauſe he hath made them ſo: yet as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour and Head of the Church he hath none; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath made none;<note place="margin">Heb. 7.24. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

For euery worke of a Mediatour is a compound worke, iſſuing from two natures concurring in the ſame action, as the carued worke of <hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> was the iſſue of their bodies and ſoules: in which reſpect there is required a ſtrength aboue any created power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (becauſe the Papiſts ſay, that the Pope is not the head of the Church in ſuch a ſoueraigne and principall manner as Chriſt, but the Miniſteriall Head ouer the whole Church vpon earth) therefore I adde this, that we cannot be ſure that a deputation of any inferiour gouernment and miniſtery, is put ouer to any one man whatſoeuer. For there are three things which doe hinder our through perſwaſion in this point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Chriſt doth reſerue euen outward adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his owne power. For it is he which ſendeth forth his word and ſpirit, which hath ordained a miniſtery, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Euangeliſts, Paſtors, Doctors, whence he is called the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:479:30"/> Arch-ſhepherd: It is he who aſſiſteth his miniſtery with power; and hath prouided the trumpet and ſword of the magiſtracy to call and to diſſolue counſels, to ſummon and to diſparcle armie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, to defend his Church (ſo farre as it is good for her) from Satan the liar by hereſie, and Satan the murtherer by perſecution. Therefore what need haue we of a miniſteriall head?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that there is no miniſteriall head but muſt worke miniſterially that which the principall head doth principally: For elſe it is but a rotten head, ſuch as the Wolfe found in the caruers ſhop, without wit or braines: But no mortall man nor Angell can doe that which Chriſt our head doth: becauſe the office of his headſhip is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by two natures, concurring in one perſon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Chriſto ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.5. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <hi>or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, but the ſame or one Lord.</hi> So that as it is with Kings who are neuer out of their kingdomes, though there are diuers officers vnder them, yet there is but one in whom there is Regall power, and that is the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo in this kingdome of heauen vpon earth, the Church I meane, though there are diuers offices, yet hee keepes the royalty in himſelfe: which if he haue put ouer vnto another, it muſt either faſten vpon him ſloth, or at the leaſt eaſe to put the burthen of gouernment vpon a weaker perſons ſhoulders, or it muſt make vs ſay that hee hath done a needleſſe thing, to make a ſubſtitute in his own preſence to doe that which is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, if Ieſus Chriſt were abſent, and it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there could be a deputy, yet wee cannot bee ſure
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:479:31"/> that the Pope is he. And of this I ſhall giue you foure grounds of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it ſtandeth vpon improbable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as can neither ariſe properly nor figuratiuely, ſuch as cannot be deriued by any ſucceſſion to confirme the doctrine which they now hold concerning their great head. They ſay that God ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will I build my Church: and to thee will I giue the keies of the kingdome of heauen:</hi> and againe, <hi>feede my ſheepe.</hi> Therefore, they ſay, he ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> (as their new doctrine concludeth) <hi>I make thee Vicar and miniſteriall head ouer all the world, both for order and iuriſdiction, ouer all Biſhops, all Chriſtians; to ſet out the rule of faith, lawes, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ouer all the world, to trample vpon kings, and to decree them to butchery or honour, as they ſerue for the good of the Catholike cauſe.</hi> Now how this and the like ſtuffe can bee inferred from the words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> to vphold their monarchicall head, I would intreat you to call your beſt Logicke to an account and to doe your beſt to iudge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe the Pope pleades more for himſelfe than he doth for him from whom he pretends to receiue deputation. He is like an vnfaithfull friend, who being ſent to ſpeake a good word, ſpeakes one for his friend and two for himſelfe. For what is it that doth imbroyle the whole Chriſtian world more than the Popes monarchie? All kingdomes muſt be at his diſpoſe, that ſo ſuch Princes as he can traine vp in dull ignorance, may through ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be prouoked to be his white ſonnes, that they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to great honours, and other mens inheritances, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. All muſt be Hereticks that are not within his Pale. The word of God muſt depend vpon his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Scripture muſt be no Scripture except he looke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably vpon it, and giue it what ſenſe pleaſeth him.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:479:31"/> Kings muſt be no Kings, if it pleaſeth him to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them: and we muſt be no miniſters, becauſe our calues are cow-calues, <q rend="inline">(as that bleſſed Martyr <hi>Woodman</hi> anſwered the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> who wanted the Popes Bull to conſecrate or confirme him in his Biſhopricke) with many other prettie toyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe all the notes of the great Antichriſt that are in Scripture doe agree to him, to wit, the Pope, as is maintained to his face by our dread Soueraigne, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Father Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> in his treatiſe of Antichriſt, and in his <hi>Diatriba</hi> of the ſame ſubiect. It is true indeed, they would make vs beleeue <q rend="inline">that his chayre is made of Iriſh wood, to which no copwebs of falſhood can cleaue, nor any venomous creature come neere without death: and that his Church is like that which the mariners built in <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> to Saint <hi>Iohn de Maluatia,</hi> whoſe very morter was tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with malmſey; a ſweet and precious Church:</q> but all the water in <hi>Tyber</hi> will not waſh off that imputation, except he doe penance for his ambition and oppoſition, and become ſuch a Biſhop as the primitiue godly Fathers were.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe it cannot be ſhewed that Chriſt hath appointed the Pope to be his Vicar, hee often ſpeaketh of the Holy Ghoſt, as when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.26.</note> 
                     <hi>The Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things:</hi> and againe, <hi>When he is come which is the Spirit of truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note> 
                     <hi>hee will lead you into all truth:</hi> but he neuer ſpeaketh of the Pope. If he doe, let him ſhew it: if he doe not, let him conſider how hatefull it is for a man to put himſelfe into ſuch high commiſſions without warrant from God: and how iuſtly wee may lay this in his diſh, <hi>No man taketh this honour but he that is called of God as Aaron was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus (I hope) you perceiue that we cannot be aſſured that that is the true Church, whereof the Pope is the head. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, God muſt pare vs to put vs into the true oliue, Chriſt, by humiliation: when we ſee how fearefully wee lie liable to Gods iuſtice, we, deſpairing of all helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort elſewhere, doe humbly lay our ſelues downe at Gods feet, to bee diſpoſed to ſhame, ſorrow, feare, confeſſion, prayer, and application of ſpirituall reaſons to our carnall hearts, to mortifie and dead our corruptions according to Gods Word.</p>

                  <p>Thus haue I ſhewed you how you may know your ſelues to be of the true Church amongſt vs,<note place="margin">Motiues.</note> that ſo your deſires may pant after it. As <hi>Dauid</hi> added two motiues to prouoke himſelfe to hunger after the houſe of the Lord: ſo ſhall I adde the ſame to further vs to deſire to be, and to be ſtill of the true Church amongſt vs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the beautie of our Church,<note place="margin">1 The beautie of our Church.</note> which doth ſtand in the beautie of that Religion which it doth profeſſe: I know that the Papiſts doe what they can to diſgrace it, and to make it appeare ougly in the ſight of men;<note place="margin">Pſ. 45.13.</note> yet (though the Kings daughter be all glorious within, and her beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments without are but needle-worke, full of ſtitches and prickes: though the whore do excell in her gariſh attire the modeſt and honeſt woman; in which reſpect it cannot grieue vs that they obiect againſt vs, as the heathens of old did againſt the leſſe ancient Chriſtians, the want of glorie in our outward ſeruice and worſhip) yet, I ſay, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:479:36"/> things which make our religion beautifull, aboue that which doth ſo much ſtand vpon outward feature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, our religion cannot bee diſgraced without lying. She is a beautifull woman, who ſtandeth ſo for currant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to them who will ſay, White is blacke, or that ſhee painteth, and borroweth complexion of Art, or the like, when it is nothing ſo: ſo is it with our religion. Yee know how often they charge vs and our religion with noueltie, when yet we doe relye vpon the firſt truth, to wit the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. So likewiſe they doe make their blinded diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that we hold, God to be the author of ſinne; likewiſe, that it is enough to haue onely faith; that the Church failed many hundred yeeres till <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluine;</hi> that all is very eaſie in Scriptures; that God forceth vs againſt our wills, without any reſpect of our conſents; that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no faſting but morall temperance and faſting from ſin; that we eſteeme nothing of Chriſtian workes towards ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but condemne them as vncleane, ſinfull, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; that God imputeth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to iuſtification though we be not iuſt; as if the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt applied by faith did not cure as well as couer, purge ſinne as well as pacifie Gods wrath for ſinne. Theſe and the like odious lies doe they put vpon vs and our religion. But bleſſed and beautifull are we when ſuch men as they are ſpeake all manner of euill againſt vs falſely. We cannot thinke our ſelues the more deformed for their falſe charges, whoſe whole Apoſtacie is a mixture of lying and vanitie from head to taile. They call the Pope <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> when he is neither able to be preſent with the whole bodie, nor infuſe capitall ſpirits into any one member. The Pope calleth himſelfe <hi>A ſeruant of ſeruants,</hi> when yet he ſeemes to be a prouder Lord than the Turke,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:479:36"/> breathing out nothing but ſoueraigntie and vnlimited iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and would thinke foule ſcorne that any earthly Potentate or King ſhould be preferred before him. Their <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will be ſo lyingly called of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the Truth; when (as it hath beene often told them, and cannot be diſproued) as <hi>Abſhalom</hi> was vniuſtly called, the <hi>Fathers peace,</hi> being the Fathers warre, ſo they are not without blaſphemie ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeeing they doe nothing more than cunnicatch the wealthy, gull the poore, diſloyalize ſubiects, conſpire againſt Princes, vndermine States and Kingdomes, and vnder the hood of Religion kindle warres, and cloſely lay the cauſe vpon others. Yea, and what is their religion but, like theſe grand practiſers, one thing in ſhew, another thing in truth, and none other but a draught of deadly wine in a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, our Religion ſtriues by all might and maine to keepe the head whole, and that is <hi>Chriſt</hi> only. Yee know that hee is called beautifull, whoſe head is ſo, though hee haue a crooked bodie, a withered hand, and a gowtie toe: ſo may our Church and Religion well be accounted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cleaue vnto, keepe whole and ſound, to our power, our whole head, (both God and Man by nature, Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and King by office) that hee might be the alone Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his people. We know how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſhare out his honour with his offices, and diuide them betweene Chriſt and others.<note place="margin">See of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fownes</hi> his <hi>Triſagion.</hi>
                     </note> His Kingly Office is parted betweene him and the Pope; his Prieſtly, betweene him and the Saints; his Propheticall, betweene him and their traditionall Church. But for vs,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.23.</note> we deſire that he may <hi>fill all in all things:</hi> we doe ſtriue that he may increaſe, though we and all the world periſh, decreaſe, and come to nothing: yea, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid of the ſword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> which was laid vp behind the <hi>Ephod, there is none to it:</hi> ſo ſay wee of our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:479:37"/> bleſſed <hi>King, Prieſt, and Prophet,</hi> there is none to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be any but hee, in whom wee will ſeeke the leaſt dragme of beautie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our Religion is not only beautifull in the head, but ſcoureth off the leaſt blot from the whole bodie. It kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all the Commandements entire. When wee conſider that they were written with Gods owne finger, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo many miracles, we neither dare change the firſt Commandement,<note place="margin">See for this <hi>Hiſpa. Refor. Bellar.</hi> Ample declaration of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> nor daſh out the ſecond, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. We dare not admit of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for feare of hauing any other god ſaue the true God. We dare not embrace Popiſh Traditions, for feare of giuing God that worſhip which is not his owne: our conſciences will not ſo farre abuſe vs, as to giue vs leaue to entertaine a ſeruice vnknowne, leſt we ſhould ſerue God in vaine, and not giue him his worſhip in the right manner: we cannot ſpend the Lords day in ſeeing <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or only in praying (though it be the ſweeteſt of our ſeruice) knowing that, becauſe God doth in the Commandement of the Sabbath, chiefly aime at our edification,<note place="margin">Eſ. 2.3.</note> we muſt goe vp to <hi>the houſe of the Lord, that he may teach vs his waies, and wee may walke in his paths.</hi> We ſettle the Chaire of State vpon Princes, renouncing a ſuperiour power among men, to excommunicate them: and put caſe the Pope doe, to his vtmoſt, hunge them with his <hi>Bulls,</hi> we renounce and hate the not accounting of them <hi>Kings,</hi> and the executing of them as delinquents to him, and to his <hi>Pope-holy-Church:</hi> Yet leſt wee ſhould flatter them, we tell them that they muſt be <hi>Fathers,</hi> not <hi>Tyrants,</hi> that ſo they may not be wilfull hinderers of that honour which is due vnto them. Hauing thus preſſed vpon the head for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly politique gouernment, we learne of God to preſſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart, the ſeat of valour, that there be no taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of life through baſe cowardiſe. Can we thinke of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:479:37"/> ſtabbings, vnderminings, ſtrengthning the hands of wickedneſſe, ſadding the hearts of the good by lies and impoſtures? We can ſooner looke vpon the perſons of our enemies without malice, their wrongs without deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, their proſperitie without enuie, and digeſt all our griefes by venting them into Gods boſome by feruent and faithfull prayer. We preſſe vpon the ſeat of Luſt, and teach our appetites, that as we muſt liue, ſo we muſt liue honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt we be a burthen to the earth. We cannot abide the ſlighting of Fornication, the blanching of Prieſts Minions and Concubines, the ſtinke of Stewes, with that curſed caution, <hi>If thou canſt not liue chaſtly, yet carrie it warily.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Si non caſtè ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cautè.</note> We teach that honeſt perſons muſt haue honeſt maintenance by poſſeſſing their owne: that they muſt maintaine their right by truth. As we cannot maintaine our Religion by lying Legends, or our perſons and cauſes by equiuocation: ſo can we not but be carefull to preſſe and teach that there be no lyer amongſt vs for gold or gaine: yea wee will not ſuffer the whole ſoule to be at reſt with her concupiſcence. Can wee flatter the heart with the neglect of the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne by the fleſh, though the ſpirit doe not conſent; as if a knaue be not a knaue, becauſe an honeſt man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues him for it? No: wee will labour that there be peace at home without mutinie, that there be ſuch <hi>ſoundneſſe of minde,</hi> and ſuch a peaceable poſſeſſion of our owne ſoules in the enioyment of God, as nothing that is others may or doe diſquiet vs. Thus doth our Religion rub off the ruſt of all ſinne, preſſing this as a note of an vpright man, <hi>to haue an equall reſpect to all Gods Commandements:</hi> yea that the leaſt rubbiſh of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> may not (by our good wills) ſticke vpon our Church, wee aime at and endeuour, the through mortification of the whole bodie of ſinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of all our hearts. The Popiſh Church, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:479:38"/> it talke of mortification, and what glorious ſhewes ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it doth make to that end, either by whippings (wherein yet <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts went beyond them) or by drawing their bloud, like Phariſee draw-blouds, or by going bare-foot, like the Heathens in their bare-foot ſolemnities,<note place="margin">Nudepedalia ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra.</note> or by their precious Pilgrimages, forced Faſtings, and the like; yet it is farre (and I pray God they may ſee it) from true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and reformation of heart. For doe but conſider that either they doe not know or will not know the right enemie wherewith they ſhould fight to this end; that is, the curſed <hi>Fleſh</hi> which is in our boſomes: For when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh of the luſts of the fleſh, which we muſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, they doe ſometimes vnderſtand our bodies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the ſuppreſſing of it,<note place="margin">Vnderſtand me not as if I did condemne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and other laudable bodily exerciſes, but onely as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by theſe principall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, what principall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie they fight againſt, to wit, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Epheſ. 5.28, 29.</note> they doe preſſe vpon bodily exerciſes, as Faſtings, whippings, Haire-cloth, bare-foot viſitings of Temples, Shrines and the like: whereas the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and the ſpirit may well goe hand in hand; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord the Church:</hi> to wit, ſo farre forth as it may be done without making Nature either proud or wanton. Sometimes againe, they doe vnderſtand the brutiſh and inferiour facultie of the ſoule, whereby it affecteth and deſireth profits, pleaſures, as meats, drinkes, cloathing, and procreation. But euen this alſo in it ſelfe cannot be ſaid to be our enemie, which being well manned, is of ſo good and neceſſarie vſe in the life of man, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it there would neither be preſeruation of particulars, nor kindes; Nature would neither preſerue it ſelfe, nor the ſucceſſion thereof in its like. In both theſe they miſſe the marke, and ſhoot at a friend in ſtead of an enemie. In which reſpect a man may goe to the height of their taught deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet be as arrant hypocrites as euer were. But as for our Church, the whole bent of it tends to perfect our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:479:38"/> ſanctification <hi>in the feare of God.</hi>

<list>
                        <item>Firſt, whether <hi>England</hi> doe permit <hi>Vſury,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth the <hi>Stewes.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Secondly, whether if wee did, it might ſtand in equall ballance with a <hi>Stewes.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer two things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that <hi>England</hi> doth not permit <hi>Vſury,</hi> but reſtraine the abominable griping that was brought in by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For if you looke into the Law, you ſhall finde it called a Statute againſt <hi>Vſury;</hi> yea it calleth <hi>Vſury</hi> a vice and ſinne, and ſaith, it is <hi>deteſtable,</hi> as you may ſee in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the <hi>Vſurers</hi> are ſo craftie, as to make their Creditours vpon the lending of an hundred pound, to become debtors to them for an hundred and ten, or eight, or ſeuen, or the like, by bond, and not to binde them to giue ten pounds for the meere vſe of an hundred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>England</hi> dealeth not with <hi>Vſury</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> doth with the <hi>Stewes;</hi> for ſhee doth blanch and excuſe it, and therefore ſometime they ſay, that it is but a permiſſion of a leſſe euill to auoid a greater, as <hi>Sodomy, Buggery,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:479:39"/> the like; when yet vnder this cloake <hi>Ely</hi> might without blame haue ſuffered the ſins of his ſonnes in the porches of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> to preuent more hainous ſinnes, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of <hi>Sodomy.</hi> Sometimes againe they tell vs that they doe not permit them without meanes to reclaime them both by puniſhments and preachings: as if it could excuſe them to permit houſes of ſinning, that they may exerciſe their cenſures: they are mad men that build hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for theeues, and burne them downe when they haue done. Sometimes againe they will tell vs that the rents and penſions ſo gotten are imployed to maintaine penitent harlots: as if God delighted in the price of a harlot, or it were lawfull for vs to doe euill that good might come thereof. Thus would the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> like a harlot, put a beautifull complexion vpon an vgly face, yea from ſuch like and other filthineſſe, euen in their holy Fathers the <hi>Popes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See <hi>Bellar.</hi> in his preface to his bookes, <hi>De Pontif. Rom.</hi>
                     </note> they can draw an argument of glory and renowne to <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, as being a ſigne of Gods ſpeciall hand that it hath endured ſo long. But as for vs, we are readie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vſurie to the pit of hell, as God ſhall cleerely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto vs what it is, and as we alreadie doe ſo farre as we are come.</p>

Yea and that all things may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the more fairely, there is the law impoſed vpon the reaſonable creature, as apprehended by him to be the rule and records.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes and grounds of this Aſſize are theſe two. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in reſpect of God; that God may haue an account of the ſtate of man from himſelfe, and man may be brought to liue in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe vnder God. For looke as a King of a country doth ordaine Aſſizes to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:479:47"/> be kept in his ſeuerall Shires and Counties, that hee may haue an account of the iuſtice of his Magiſtrates, eſtate of his country, liues of his ſubiects, and that he may preſerue them in peace and loue in their ſeuerall places: ſo God hath appointed this petty Aſſize, that he may haue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the conſcience how the minde doth rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne; how the whole man is gouerned in righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and ſobriety; how the ſtate of the body and ſoule ſtands before God in the caſe of life and death; and that the deſires and affections may be kept from mutinie and rebellion, and the whole man may be brought vnder the ſubiection of Gods will.<note place="margin">Vel medio humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis naturalis, vel medio luminis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei.</note> Our vnderſtandings, either by the light of reaſon, or by the light of faith, ſhould haue the law of God preſented vnto them, whereby they ſhould ſuruey both morall duties, and the myſticall points of Diuinitie; our inuentions ſhould finde out variety of dutie for vs; our memories ſhould keepe the records; our wils ſhould chuſe and command all good actions; our iudgements ſhould ſit at hand, to giue aduice; our affections ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon them, to maintaine and defend all honeſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and actions againſt all commers; and laſtly, our deſires ſhould worke naturall inſtincts to practiſe them, and the whole man ſhould doe accordingly. Or thus; God hath placed the powers of the ſoule in excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the gouernment of man. Our mindes in a throne aboue, to gouerne all the motions, diſpoſitions, paſſions, and affections of the heart: our hearts are ſet in the midſt to receiue information from the mindes to direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and our deſires, and valorouſly to flie vpon them by feare, loue, ioy, anger, and the like, if they ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond ground of our Aſſize is in reſpect of our ſelues; that we may be the better prepared for the great Aſſize of the day of Iudgement whenſoeuer it ſhall come. Yee know that we beleeue that ſuch a day ſhall come, and that Chriſt ſhall keepe it in that nature which he aſſumed, and wherein he ſuffered. As therefore all our muſterings before particular Captaines ſhould not be for ſhew or fee, but the better to fit vs to carry our ſelues in a martiall manner before our King, or Generall, if need require: ſo theſe particular Aſſizes are but for the better fitting of vs for our great account before, and vnto God.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is ignorance. For as the eye worketh not in a darke place, where it cannot by a fitted conueiance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue variety of obiects: ſo the conſcience worketh not where there is not the light of knowledge from the word of God to direct it by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is hardneſſe of heart: for as a man that is dead, or hath a deaded or aſtoniſhed bodie, for the preſent cannot feele any order or diſorder, any whip, laſh or gaſh: ſo a ſeared, cruſted, and ſenſeleſſe conſcience is not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the curſed garboiles in the ſoule, nor capable of any orderly proceeding againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is ſpirituall madneſſe: for as mad men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is our praiers to God to write the records of his truth in our mindes and hearts. An Aſſize cannot be kept without law; nor this without the law of God.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, where conſcience terrifieth, no creature can comfort: the pleaſures of Paradiſe auailed not <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was driuen to hide his head in a buſh: the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Canaan</hi> did <hi>Dauid</hi> little pleaſure, when he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to cry out, <hi>My ſinne is euer before me.</hi> All the delights of <hi>Babylon</hi> could not raiſe vp <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> heart, when the hand wrote Gods ſentence againſt him on the wall and in his conſcience. If the Iudge condemne, who ſhall abſolue? Excellent is that ſimilitude which an ancient makes to this purpoſe. <hi>A man condemned to die trieth his three friends to procure his pardon:</hi> one ſaith, <hi>I haue no grace with the King, and therefore I can promiſe thee no ſuch kindneſſe: yet this will I doe, I will buy thee meat, and drinke, garments, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: thou ſhalt want nothing that may giue thee content while thou art here.</hi> All this is good, and yet it contents not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poore man wanteth a pardon.

The third ſaith, <hi>Reſt vpon my kindneſſe, I am one of the Kings fauourites, and he will deny me nothing: I will goe to the court and before the day of execution I will ſurely bring thy pardon ſealed.</hi> This is he: this is the friend that will make the poore man out-face all his trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he anſwereth to the point indeed. Behold the caſe

The world will prouide all neceſſaries for our bodies, but not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: this is not purchaſed with a corruptible price of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold. Wife and children will lament our loſſe, and goe ſighing and ſobbing to the graue with vs, but they leaue vs to our owne ſhifts for a pardon. But a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will make vs outſtand all dangers, it will procure our peace, and our pardon.

                     <hi>Heare the Word of the Lord all ye that tremble at his Word; your brethren that hated you, and caſt you out for my Names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified: but hee ſhall appeare to your ioy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> Laſtly, we muſt doe our dutie to conſcience, by paying tribute to it, and yeelding to it honourable meanes of maintenance. <hi>Giue tribute to whom tribute belongeth:</hi> ſhall wee haue a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and will wee ſtarue him for want of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? God forbid. Decke therefore the table of thy conſcience richly with the Word of God; let thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vſe it as in the ſight and preſence of God; attend with all the parts and powers of thy bodie and ſoule in ſtate vpon this honourable gouernour: and if thou canſt not giue it entertainment anſwerable to its place, weepe to God for more grace; that as one ſaid to Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> weeping mother;<note place="margin">Non poteſt perire tantarum lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum filius.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Conſcience, as a Iudge, muſt doe its office, to and for vs, both in our ſelues, and to God: for looke as a Iudge doth a double dutie a dutie of iuſtice in the country, and a dutie of account in the Court: ſo likewiſe hath the conſcience a double dutie to performe In the Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, we muſt expect a fourefold action of a Iudge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:479:60"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt is <hi>Remurmuration:</hi> As a Iudge doth or ſhould fret and grudge at euery euill cauſe that comes before him, and cannot abide that any <hi>Gallio</hi> ſhould either plead the excuſe or defence of it: ſo conſcience muſt worke an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, when any of the aduocates of ſinne doth blanch the leaſt wickedneſſe. The leaſt ſinne is helliſh in its ſight, the greateſt is ten times damnable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is <hi>Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Looke as a Iudge doth or ſhould prouoke to euery good occaſion for the repreſſing of vice, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue: ſo conſcience muſt goad vs vp, and ſtirre vs forward to take euery good opportunitie to doe good vnto our bodies and ſoules to the honour of God. The Iewes who were as the ſwift <hi>Dromodaries,</hi> were not more eager to commit wickedneſſe, than conſcience muſt be to doe that which is good in Gods ſight. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Euen as a Iudge doth condemne the guilty, and pronounce definitiue ſentence againſt him whatſoeuer he be, whether friend or foe, rich or poore, becauſe he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth cauſes ſpeake, and not perſons: ſo dealeth conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yea euen againſt the owner of it, if he doe offend. Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of thoſe who are <hi>ſelfe-condemned.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">Or looke as if a ſouldier demeane himſelfe not well in battell, the Iudge Martiall may cauſe his <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon</hi> to be pierced:</q> Euen ſo conſcience muſt pierce the heart of the offender by a full pronouncing of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of its God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth is <hi>Abſolution.</hi> As a Iudge doth abſolue the guiltleſſe, and when his innocencie doth once appeare, doth make no delayes, or demurres, or the like to keepe him from the comfort of his cauſe: ſo when conſcience findeth innocencie, it crieth out, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſeruant, enter into thy Maſters ioy.</hi> Know thine office conſcience.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is a dutie of account that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence oweth vnto God alſo. Euen as a Iudge doth giue an account vnto his Soueraigne of the ſtate of his countrey, liues of his people, and iuſtice of his inferiour Magiſtrates, and the like: ſo muſt our conſciences giue an account to God what ſtate our ſoules are in, and how our wills and affections doe rule and obey within vs. See therefore (O conſcience) that thou doe it faithfully. Goe to the Court of heauen after euery daies <hi>Aſsize:</hi> tell God how it ſtands with thee in the caſe of life and death. <hi>Helpe O King,</hi> I haue found rebellion in thy kingdome, without thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all will periſh: with thy pardon without thy wiſdome to plant religion, to order thy ſubiects, and to preuent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mutinies, all will come to naught. Thus deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with thy ſoule: And as good Iudges will not truſt particular Iuſtices with the gouernment of the Countrey (leſt they ſhould make their owne gaines and aime at their owne priuate ends, more than at the publike good) but will diligently ſearch into their proceedings, that ſo their account may be the more current: ſo the good conſcience will not commit the gouernment of the ſoule to the will and affections, but will euery day ſearch into their courſes, that ſo they may giue the more through and honeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto our God and King.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing viewed the power of practicall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe reaſoning thoughts which are in vs,<note place="margin">2 The abuſe of the power of Conſcience.</note> we come to the abuſe of this power, in iudging euilly and partially euen againſt conuiction. Whence we may note,
<q>That it is no newes that there is diſorder and corruption in the iudgements of our owne hearts and conſciences.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yee know that <hi>Paul</hi> found out this wickedneſſe of old,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:479:61"/> 
                     <hi>To withhold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> euen ſo is it ſtill. The priſoner to be tried within vs is Truth; the caſe to be tried, is, whether Truth ſhould be ſet at libertie to be a guide to our actions, yea or no? Truth pleades for her ſelfe, as the cauſe of poore Chriſtians in this place: but the Iurie of will and affections heareth not: they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with carnall wiſdome, pleaſure, profit, or the like: and therefore in commeth the fore-man <hi>(Will)</hi> and ſaith, I will doe as I haue done, and I will be perſwaded, as I haue beene perſwaded: and ſo Reaſon like a corrupt Iudge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſentence that Truth muſt into priſon, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wickedneſſe flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>If now you will aske me, what are the reaſons of this corruption in our inward iudgings? I anſwer, that I ſhall giue you foure reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the want of the loue of God. If we loued God, we would loue his honour: if wee loued his honour, wee would carrie an equall and vpright courſe in paſſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; yea though it were to the cruſhing of that which is moſt deare vnto vs.<note place="margin">Deut. 33.9.</note> Thus <hi>Leui</hi> is ſaid to ſay to his father and mother, <hi>I haue not ſeene thee,</hi> neither knew he his owne brethren, nor his children, when hee was to execute the iudgements of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, want of vnion in our ſelues. An armie put to rowt cannot keepe order: ſo neither can a man that is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in himſelfe. As it is in the curſed Alehouſe buſineſſe, it thriues the better for a proud ſeparation that is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that ſhould helpe it (to wit, when what one Iuſtice ſets vp, another pulleth downe; and what one pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe, another ſetteth vp:) ſo is it with theſe curſed diſorders within, from that iarre betwixt: Reaſon, Will, Affections and Deſires, that is found in vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, ſelfe-loue: For as in the Common-wealth,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:479:61"/> many perſons of vile conditions are maintained, or ſome profit which is reaped from them; and many houſes of notorious diſorder are vpheld (as if they were the very life-bloud of ſocieties wherein we liue) for the greatneſſe of that rent which they may bring vnto vs: ſo is there much diſorder in our inward iudiciall proceedings, becauſe wee loue our ſelues too well. All our Logicke is too little to conclude for our ſelues, and all our reaſon imployed to bring ſackes to our owne mills for the time by profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, honours, and the like; and for after times, let come what can come, we care not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, skilfulneſſe in ſubtill euaſions: for as it is in the Common-wealth, becauſe almoſt no bond, leaſe, conueyance, or will is ſo ſure, but a cunning head can finde a hole to make worke for vncharitable perſons; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no cauſe is ſo good, but an innocent man, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in his cauſe, and careleſſe in the meanes to cleare it, may by ſubtiltie be ouerthrowne; therefore there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorders in Courts of outward Iuſtice: ſo becauſe there are infinite ſubtilties to daube ouer the conſcience for a time, there are many diſorders in the inward court of our hearts. Religion did neuer thriue worſe, than when the Schoole-men had perplexed euery part with varietie of queſtions and multitudes of <hi>quaeres,</hi> whereby Religion was drawne from the heart to the head: and the kinde worke of conſcience neuer went on leſſe to our comfort, than ſince we healed the hurt of it with ſweet words, and ſtopped vp the mouth of it with politicke euaſions.</p>

We muſt ſuſpect it of felonie and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt God; therefore we muſt lay hands vpon it, and reſolue that it ſhall not haue that liberty to play its prancks as it hath had.

                  <p>Thirdly, for the executing of ſinne wee muſt die with Chriſt: for by faith we muſt ſet our ſelues in his roome, and feele ſo neere an vnion betwixt him and vs, that his death may really be ours, and wee virtually die in him.

I well knew mine owne weakneſſe, and the weight of a preſſes burthen. Yet conſidering how apt the weake mud-wals of my poore houſe are euery yeere to fall, and withall that it is not altogether impoſsible that I ſhould doe ſome ſmall good vnto my good people, euen when I am dead by ſome ſhort Mementoes of what I haue formerly taught, I thought that it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me a little to write ſomething, whereby the weake faith of me vnworthy thy <hi>Abel</hi> might ſpeake being dead, and in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of which, I might not be altogether vnmindfull of the kindneſſes and fauours of my louing friends. Hence then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this Sermon to appeare; which though in reſpect of the manner, it be rude and homely, yet it hath matter which is worth our conſideration. It preſſeth ſobrietie, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prayer, which are neceſſary and vſefull duties euery day: and it will ſtand vp as a little ſea-marke, to point at thoſe rockes of the Papacie, from which it hath pleaſed God hitherto to preſerue you. I know that your temptations haue not beene
<pb facs="tcp:479:89"/> ſmall nor ſeldome; kindred and kinde opportunities haue giuen much aduantage to the tempters: but by how much more open you lay, by ſo much greater appeareth the glory of God in your weakneſſes, which haue beene preſerued from the defilements of the filth of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Long and euer may that gratious worke be continued vpon you and yours: And I humbly pray God, that (as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did vſe to offer in ſacrifice to their curſed gods of the fruit of the Peach-tree, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnlike to a mans heart; and of the leaues of the ſame, which are like to a mans tongue; thereby teaching that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth both tongue and heart: ſo) you may ſtill continue and abound in offering vp the outward and inward man, in publike and priuate ſeruices to the true God. I hope that from ſound knowledge you doe throughly hate the many lies, wherewith our aduerſaries doe ſeeke to diſgrace vs and our cauſe (as of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, impuritie, and blaſphemie of our Religion and the like:) and haue learned from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Law, after the third lie, to enioyne a man perpetuall ſilence; or, if that be not in your power, yet neuer to beleeue him more. I know that as it is ſaid of <hi>Aſpes,</hi> they are of a skie colour, and hide their inuenomed teeth within ſoft gummes: ſo yee ſhall ſee, and haue ſeene, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> veluet-mouthed, and like heauen in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, muſtering the Fathers, yea and Scriptures in ſuch order and equipage, as if in the cauſe of Religion all were theirs: but I remember what we reade of <hi>Balme,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:479:90"/> their impoſtures of falſe doctrine whatſoeuer. Let mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſeech you, in the entertainment of any doctrine, to vſe Gods ſpectacles ſtill, that no falſe colours may deceiue you to the preiudice of your ſoules: and ſo to prouide for ſobrietie and watchfulneſſe in prayer in theſe perilous times, that yee may not be like to vnthriftie ſeruants, who hauing their allowance of candle, ſpend it out in gaming and riot, and at the laſt are faine to goe to bed darkling. This would be a wofull abuſe of that light of knowledge which God hath giuen you. From this therefore euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt (who hath preſerued your Worſhips hitherto) keepe both you and yours for euermore. Thus he humbly prayeth, who heartily deſireth the well-fare of your bodies and ſoules:</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is drawne from that communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which we haue with Ieſus Chriſt, our Head, in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs</hi> (and in our roome) <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> that is, in his humane nature.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Argument is drawne from that wrong which we haue done vnto God already, by our vnholineſſe in times paſt. <hi>It is ſufficient for vs that we haue ſpent the time paſt of the life after the luſts of the Gentiles:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, we haue done wrong enough vnto God alreadie in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wickedly: let vs not for ſhame goe on ſtill, but let vs now liue vnto God.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:479:91"/> they ſpeake euill of you: but yet know that they ſhall giue an account to him that is readie to iudge quicke and dead. As if he ſhould ſay, <q rend="inline">Looke as it is with a Bat or Flinder-mouſe, it is in kinde like a bird, and it flieth like a bird, but it doth not bring forth young like a bird, nor feed them like a bird, nor feed it ſelfe like a bird:</q> So yee that are the children of God, though in reſpect of kinde yee be men, though in ciuill and naturall conuerſation yee walke like men, yet yee are neither bred nor fed like men, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed, and with immortall food, and ſo are odde perſons form the common rout of the world, <hi>as Pellicans in the wilderneſſe, and Owles in the deſert.</hi> In which reſpect yee may not wonder if worldly men doe carie themſelues like ſtrangers vnto you.

                  <p>Now, the Apoſtle being come thus farre, doth ſeeme to remoue two obiections to the end of my Text. The firſt is of carnall men, who to flatter themſelues in their owne vngodly courſes, might ſay; If we be let alone till the day of iudgement, we ſhall doe well enough: for wee hope it will be no worſe with vs, than with thoſe who are dead, who walked without controule in the ſame courſes. Doe not ſay ſo (ſaith <hi>Peter:</hi>) for though they are dead, yet while they were aliue the Goſpell was preached vnto them to this end, that ſinne might be killed and grace might be quickened.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Scope.</note>Thus wee haue ſeene the context; whence the ſcope doth eaſily appeare to be this; to wit, partly to giue comfort vnto croſſed Chriſtians, becauſe the time was not long: and partly to keepe their ſpirits from deadneſſe and dulneſſe (through the diſcouragements of wicked men) that they may be found worthy through Ieſus Chriſt in that day when the Iudge ſhall iudge both.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe euen wee alſo haue experience of the <hi>gaine-ſayings of vnreaſonable men,</hi> and of our owne curſed dulneſſe and backwardneſſe through them: therefore it is not vnfit for vs in theſe times of ſinne thorowly alſo to conſider theſe words.</p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>meaning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meaning.</note> there is no ſuch difficultie in them as ſhould cauſe our ſtay, which wee ſhall not more fitly meet with in our further purſuit of them. Onely for the preſent conſider we two points in the words:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Doctrine,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>The end of all things is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A Vſe,</hi> or inference vpon it, wherein the Apoſtle doth preſſe to a double dutie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>Sobrietie,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Be yee therefore ſober.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Prayer:</hi> which is expreſſed both by the matter, in this word <hi>(prayer:)</hi> and alſo by the meanes furthering it, in theſe words <hi>(watch vnto it.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, if yee will, the Apoſtle doth rather preſſe to a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dutie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt concerneth vs as we ſtand in relation to the world, and that is <hi>Sobriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond concerneth vs as we haue reſpect to

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third concerneth vs as we haue reference to God, and that is <hi>Prayer.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; <hi>Let your watchfulneſſe which may giue you experience of your weake eſtates, and make knowne the vigilancie of your enemies, and your owne neceſsities, driue you to God in Ieſus Chriſt by Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>Doctrine,</hi>

                  <p>And if the Apoſtle might ſay ſo, much more may we, <hi>vpon whom the ends of the world are</hi> more <hi>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening therefore of this point conſider with me three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is meant by the end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is compriſed vnder theſe words <hi>(All things.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how the Apoſtle could ſay, that <hi>the end of all things is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt point,<note place="margin">1 End.</note> (not to ſtand vpon that Schoole-diſtinction of a conſummating, and a conſuming end) the end of a thing is taken diuers waies. Firſt, for that which firſt moueth the agent, and for the which ſomething is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: as Gods owne glory is the end of all things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Salomon, God made all things for himſelfe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov.</note> and our comfort and inſtruction is the end of the Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> 
                     <hi>That which is written before is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope;</hi> and the fulfilling and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Law is the end of Chriſts comming, according to that of <hi>Paul, Chriſt is the end of the Law.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> it is taken for the perfection of a thing: as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:479:93"/> end of the commandement is loue;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> that is, the perfection of the Law.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.11.</note> So likewiſe when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſe things are written to admoniſh vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come;</hi> ſome interpret <hi>(end)</hi> by perfection: becauſe in Chriſt and the Apoſtles times the world was in its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thirdly, <hi>End</hi> is taken for the iſſue and vpſhot of a thing whither at the length it comes: ſo the end of faith is <hi>the ſaluation of our ſoules;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.9. Rom. 6.22.</note> &amp; <hi>the end of holineſſe is euerlaſting life;</hi> that is, the iſſue of faith and holineſſe is glory with the Saints in heauen. Laſtly, it is taken for the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and finall concluſion of a thing, in reſpect of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and condition: ſo God ſaith to <hi>Noah, An end of all fleſh is come before me;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.13.</note> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I will caſt the world into a new mold;</hi> and thus is it taken in this place. For <hi>the end of all things</hi> is as much as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>It hath beene a long time diſputed, whether God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost be alone to be reſted in as our faithfull Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, yea or no, or whether we may cleaue vnto ſinne. Now God is come vnto the concluſion, to deſtroy and take away all outward confidence whatſoeuer: and to reſolue in the ſight of men and Angels that we muſt only cleaue vnto God by caſting the gaine-ſayers into the pit of hell, and receiuing the maintainers into euerlaſting habitations, where are pleaſures at the right hand of God for euermore.</hi>

Secondly, as the worlds diſeaſes doe argue that the end is at hand: ſo let it not be ouer-curious to ſay, that the conqueſt which fire getteth ouer the world may perſwade vs alſo in ſome meaſure that it is euen ſo indeed.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:479:98"/> charge, yet they are ſo farre from paſſing iudgement other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than (by the helpe of ſuch meanes as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) by applying the rule of the Word to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be ruled, that it breedeth vnſpeakable reſpect, when the people ſhall ſee that their Teachers teach them no other doctrine than that which is warranted by the word of God.</p>

Except therefore that we will not anſwer Gods end and expectation, we muſt watch ouer Doctrine.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, this is one reaſon why the Apoſtles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their doctrine by the Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wit, not becauſe they wanted authoritie to put what they deliuered vpon the word of God, but becauſe we might be drawne on and encouraged to ſee the conſent of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and to ſearch with the men of <hi>Berea</hi> in the Scriptures, for thoſe doctrines which wee doe entertaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, and laſtly, we may be moued to watch ouer that doctrine which is deliuered vnto vs, by conſidering what glorious meanes in appearance the aduerſaries of the truth haue to gaine vpon our affections, that they may infatuate our iudgements. For doe but marke what vſually they

Oh what faire pretences are here (if they were true) to draw our hearts to hearken to their Antichriſtian doctrine! But, as we loue our ſoules, let vs watch, and theſe things ſhall not moue vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt, we depend not vpon any priuate man or ſpirit for that doctrine which we allow, but vpon the publike Spirit of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpeaking in the Scriptures. We em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not the Scriptures for mans ſake (as the Papiſts doe ſo farre as the Pope approueth) but man and his opinions for the Scriptures ſake, and ſo farre as we finde them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, ſo farre we conſent vnto them.</p>

Firſt, put caſe that <hi>Luther</hi> had ſaid, that the Deuill did preach vnto him the true doctrine of the Sacrament: Is it any newes that the Deuill ſhould preach the truth to diſgrace it? Doth nor Ieſus Chriſt for this cauſe hinder the Deuil from ſaying that he knew him,<note place="margin">Marke 1.34.</note> becauſe he needed not his teſtimonie (though he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die enough to giue it) which could doe him no good?

Euen as if the plague were about vs, carnall wiſdome it ſelfe would make vs to looke to our feet, and to beware that wee come not neare thoſe dwellings:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.15. Hebr. 12.13.</note> So doth watchfulneſſe make vs <hi>walke cicum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, and make ſtraight ſteps</hi> to preuent the plague of ſinne. Or as if a Wolfe were about our houſes, euen natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wiſdome would make vs carefull to kill him; ſo will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:479:106"/> ſpirituall watchfulneſſe make vs watchfull to cruſh ſinne: yea euen as if wee ſhould ſee a Boy creepe in at our win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, we would watch him as narrowly as if he were a man, becauſe though he could not doe vs much hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet he could let in men which might depriue vs of our goods and liues, ſo, if we apprehend the leaſt ſin gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon vs, we muſt be as diligent in watching againſt it, as if it were of a greater ſize, becauſe it doth open the ſoule and prepare it for the greateſt ſinnes that are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, watchfulneſſe about grace is a holy care to nouriſh the ſpirit, and to take all good occaſions to bring forth and practiſe grace and godlineſſe. As a man that doth deſire and will to be rich, doth cheriſh in himſelfe all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours to that end, and wait all occaſions to be fingring the pence: So watchfulneſſe doth worke in a man an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance vpon all holy meanes to increaſe grace, with the increaſings of God.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Where we muſt watch.</note>If now you ſhall aske me, where this watch muſt be ſet?

Matt. 15.18, 19.</note> the hand workes, and the eye ſees; by how much more authoritie the heart hath in vs, by ſo much more carefull we muſt be to watch ouer the faithfulneſſe of it. Secondly, we muſt watch in our minds, that they do not roaue about vnprofitable and vnneceſſarie things. Though we labour to know other things which are of vſe in this world, yet we

Thirdly, we muſt watch in our ſenſes: for they are the cinqueports of the ſoule, both to let in that euill which the Deuill doth ſowe in the creatures, and to let out that inward corruption in our hearts to ſtrengthen our outward enemies.

                  <p>In which deſcription you may perceiue that hee that would pray muſt haue theſe ſix things in ſome degree or other to meet in him.</p>

Thus haue you heard the Apoſtles doctrine and the exhortations which he hath inferred vpon it. A more profitable theame, I am ſure, wee could not haue had in theſe laſt ages.

Now we are ſo farre from ſobrietie, that Couetouſneſſe and Epicuriſme doe lord it. Now wee are ſo farre from watchfulneſſe, that Securitie hath taken hold of the beſt. Now we are ſo farre from praying, that God is not in all our thoughts. What ſhall I therefore now ſay? I will humbly beſeech you not to forget that the end of all things is at hand; that ſo wee may be ſtirred vp to theſe things, leſt God doe ſuddenly come in flaming fire, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vengeance vnto vs before we be aware.</p>

But according to the cuſtome of the Gentiles it is to bee racked and faſtned to a croſſe, with nailes driuen through the hands and feet of a liuing man, and ſo to continue vnto death. Thus Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but not <hi>Paul,</hi> or we. The ſecond is a virtuall cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying;

As if hee ſhould ſay; It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I haue the ſame naturall organs or inſtruments, the ſame head, tongue, hands, and feete: but as there is great difference betweene a well-tuned Cymball, and a loud Cymball; ſo is there betweene all my parts, when they doe receiue actiuitie from God and from nature. As the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life is a death, in reſpect of the glorious life, (which is the cauſe that that life which wee ſhall haue in glory is for excellencie ſake called <hi>Life</hi>) ſo the naturall life is no better than a death in reſpect of the life of grace.</p>

If you aske me, how that can be? I anſwer, that it is by vertue of that communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which we haue with him. For as wee haue a naturall fellowſhip with him, by his aſſuming and ſanctifying our natures, and becomming fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone: and as we haue a ſacramentall fellowſhip with him, when in the Sacrament Chriſt is exhibited and giuen to the faithfull receiuer, as he is able to receiue it for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:479:119"/> of his ſoule: (which communion doth in this differ from a bare ſpirituall communion,<note place="margin">Signis adhibitis, vel non.</note> that all ſacramentall communion is ſpirituall, but all ſpirituall is not ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, becauſe this is in the lawfull vſe of Gods ſignes to this purpoſe.) So we haue a ſpirituall fellowſhip with Chirſt, when the ſpirit of God doth apply Chriſt vnto vs by faith, and doth ſo bring home and concorporate him vnto vs, that from the fountaine of his holineſſe, in whom all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe dwelleth, we finde our ſelues inclined and quickned to all holy obedience, and can feelingly ſay, That in that we forſake ſinne, it is from the power of Chriſt, and in that wee purpoſe and endeuour good, it is by the ſame power alſo. And of this ſpirituall communion doth the Apoſtle ſpeake in this place.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth phraſe is in theſe words, <hi>[I liue in the fleſh.]</hi> He doth not ſay that he liued of the fleſh, or after the fleſh, as if he danced after natures pipe, but <hi>[In the fleſh.]</hi> As all are not <hi>Iſrael, that are in Iſrael;</hi> ſo all are not of the fleſh, or after the fleſh, that are in the fleſh: What therefore is it to liue in the fleſh?

I liue by faith which doth its right office to ſpie out, to run vnto, and to receiue the Sonne of God. For whereas vpon the former ſpeech, that Ieſus liued in him, it might be ſaid; Muſt not the heauens containe him? Yes, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,

                     <hi>for he liueth in me by faith, not by ſight.</hi> But you will ſay, why is it called, <hi>the faith of the Sonne of God?</hi> Not becauſe wee ſhould conceiue that faith which <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> had in himſelfe, but that faith in vs, whereby he is had and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of vs: and is ſo called for three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the Sonne of God hath purchaſed it for vs. The Father would not haue willed it vs, the Holy Ghoſt would not haue wrought it in vs, if Chriſt had not bought it for vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe only the Son of God in Chriſt doth make our faith to be lawfull and laudable. As Chriſt is man he is a creature, and we muſt not flie to any creature for life and ſaluation, and therefore not beleeue in him. This then is it which makes our faith in him to be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that hee is the onely Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is not beleefe in any other perſon in the diuine nature, that doth conueigh life vnto vs. As veines, arteries, ſinewes, muſcles, and the like, doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh life, ſenſe, and motion into the parts of a mans body, but as they doe receiue them from their owne proper head and heart from whence they are ſhot: ſo faith doth not conueigh ſpirituall life, but as it doth receiue it from our ſpirituall head Chriſt Ieſus.

                  <p>Thus we haue the ſeuerall phraſes of the Text, which in their totall ſum make vp the Apoſtles meaning to be thus much.<note place="margin">Summe of the Text.</note> Doe not thinke that, by the doctrine of Iuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if we reſpect the goodneſſe of grace, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by two effectuall words for this purpoſe. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi>

If as a man ſurcharged with groſſe humours, is neuer at eaſe till he haue abated them by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or purge; ſo we oppreſſed with our ſinnes can haue no reſt in our ſoules, till wee haue diſcouered ſinne to our ſelues by examination, opened it to God by confeſſion, executed reuenge vpon it by godly ſorrow, and purged it by faith in Chriſt: then ſinne is in a good degree to death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by theſe two concomitants which goe with it. Firſt, the ſenſe of ſinne muſt decay: If therefore our eyes doe feebly behold vanitie, and not with that vigour and content as before; if our eares cannot endure to heare of it; if we flie from the garment ſpotted of the fleſh, as from a Serpent; if we finde no relliſh and ſauour in it, but with an honeſt heart can ſay to it, as to an vnprofitable thing, Get thee hence; then are wee in a ſecond degree in the death of ſinne. But if ſecondly wee are come to the pangs of this death, and doe finde that our ſins (through our lothneſſe to forſake them) haue ſtriued and ſtruggled as for life, haue diſturbed the peace of our ſoules, haue ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fleſh, as thoſe that mourne for the death of their friends, haue comforted the ſpirit, as thoſe that reioyce at the death of enemies; and ſo haue made the paines of the new birth the greater; then are we a degree further in the death vnto ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we ſhall know it by theſe conſequents which follow vpon it, to wit, coldneſſe and putrefaction. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heat of ſinne be ouer,<note place="margin">Eſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the feare of God, let vs now returne into our owne hearts and examine our ſelues, when we are ſtill, by theſe ſignes, to ſee what proceedings we haue made in paſſing from death to life; that ſo if we finde our ſelues to haue part in the firſt Reſurrection, we may be aſſured of our portion in glory to come.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus brought home <hi>Paul</hi> his method vnto our conſciences, and knowing that theſe two things are ſpeciall meanes vnder God to worke it vpon vs; to wit, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our danger, and the knowledge of our deliuerance: therefore let vs goe on to conſider <hi>Paul</hi> his matter in this Text.

                  <p>Neither is this obſcurely ſignified by the Ancients, when they doe compare a ſinner, who goeth on in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall courſe, to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had beene dead foure daies.

                  <p>Firſt, what is the reaſon that ſo many heare the word, and ſo few are benefited? Truly herein lieth the cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:479:124"/> men want faith, and ſo are dead. Call, and hollow, and whoope in the eare of a dead man, pinch and pull him, yet he ariſeth neuer the ſooner; and we doe not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe he is dead: ſo neither can we wonder that thoſe who are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, doe not heare the voice of God and liue; becauſe they are dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we learne that we haue no diſpoſition in our ſelues to faith and goodneſſe. Alas, wee thinke that wee haue faith to pleaſe God withall at an houres warning; therefore we preſume to goe on in ſinne till the houre of death. But can a dead man command faith in the houre of need? I know that when God hath inlightned the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and reuealed <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the obiect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and reſted in, and ſanctified our ſoules by giuing vs <hi>the ſpirit of faith,</hi> which taketh away our naturall death, then we are co-workers with God (according to that old and true ſaying, <hi>The will being first wrought vpon,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we learne from hence alſo, that ſo long as we are without faith, our bodies are but (as it were) our dead ſoules graues.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> If the bodies of Gods children are an <hi>earthly houſe,</hi> or a houſe of mud walls as well as others, then the bodies of naturall men cannot but be loathſome graues.

                     </gap>ll things wee are dead, as I haue ſaid. Laſtly, as a graue doth make that bodie that is put into it to rot, and turnes it for the moſt part into its owne common nature: ſo the bodie (if God doe not worke by the miracle of faith, and ſuſtaine vs by vertue of the couenant) will more corrupt, and make the blinde ſoule more earthly, ſenſuall, and deuilliſh. For as hee that cannot worke but by a bad inſtrument, will be brought ſo out of ſquare, that cuſtome will breed another nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bring forth better fruits: ſo the ſoule being tied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie as to its proper inſtrument (it not being eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſpirit of faith) through cuſtome and long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance is brought to rot in bodily exerciſes and earthly things. Seeing therefore that our bodies are graues for our naturall dead ſoules, oh that all of vs might take notice of it! All I ſay, both good and bad: that the good might be weary of the world, ſeeing their whole life is but a liuing in <hi>Golgotha</hi> among dead mens graues and skuls: that the bad might content themſelues with a meane graue, except they had more hope of a comfortable reſurrection. That dead man were but poſſeſſed with Deuils, who hauing no hope of a ioyfull reſurrection, ſhould ſpend all his time
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:479:125"/> in dreſſing vp and adorning his graue: ſo are all dead men in ſinne, who, hauing no hope of the fauour of God, and of Chriſts dwelling in their hearts by faith, doe yet ſpend all their time in prouiſion for the graue of their bodie, the very throat whereof is an open ſepulchre, venting the ſtinke of their rotten hearts.</p>

Haſt thou a huſband, a wife, a childe, or any friend, or enemie that hath not faith? Pitty them, mourne ouer them as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ouer dead <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and as thou wouldſt mourne ouer thy dead friend.

Oh that we would neuer forget to deale thus with thoſe to whom we ſtand neereſt in relation, that ſo at the length cuſtome, if not conſcience, may preuaile with vs to doe it vnto others; eſpecially conſidering (as I ſaid before) that it is full of diſcontent and miſery to ſpend our daies among dead mens tombes.</p>
                  <p>Come we now from this miſerable eſtate of ours by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to our eſtate by grace. Touching which, the firſt point which the Text offereth to be conſidered is this;
<q>That we haue communion and fellowſhip in the ſuffering and death of Christ.</q>

                  <p>This is plaine from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>[I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Christ;]</hi> which cannot be but by vertue of our

                  <p>Now that we may the better conceiue it, we muſt know that we haue fellowſhip with Chriſt in three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in his Natures: for the Sonne of God is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the humane nature, that hee might make vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the diuine nature.

                  <p>Secondly, we haue fellowſhip with Chriſt in his goods: for (wee hauing nothing elſe that may be truly ſaid to be ours) hee takes our curſed ragges of ſinne vpon him, and

                     <hi>and wee ſit with him in heauenly places.</hi> His debaſed eſtate alſo is ours, as his birth, ſuffering vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, his death, his deſcenſion into hell: For hence is it that we are ſaid to be <hi>buried with Chriſt,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Hab.</note> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which doctrine we may learne two profitable leſſons: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> firſt, concerning our ſelues; and ſecondly, concerning others. Concerning our ſelues we learne, that as the life of a man doth take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man, and quicken all the parts of him, and by degrees driueth out all the death which there it findeth: ſo faith poſſeſſeth, quickneth, &amp; driueth out death from the whole ſoule. As when water is ſet ouer the fire, that heat which doth come vnto it doth by degrees poſſeſſe, warme, &amp; driue out the cold of it: or as when the ſap doth in the ſpring ariſe out of the root of the tree into the bodie and branches, it doth take away all the vnfruitfulnes of it, &amp; by degrees doth make it bring forth bud, leafe, and fruit: ſo faith dealeth with our ſoules. For as the life of man is a power diffuſed through the whole man: ſo faith being the life of the ſoule is a power diffuſed thorow the whole ſoule. So that faith muſt be both in the minde, and in the heart. It muſt ſhew it ſelfe in the minde in three things. Firſt,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:479:129"/> in the knowledge; for there is ſomething euen in the very inlightning of the vnderſtanding, which is of the nature of faith. Therefore the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſ. 53.11.</note> that <hi>the knowledge of thy righteous ſeruant</hi> (that is, CHRIST) <hi>ſhall iuſtifie many;</hi> which yet cannot be wrought without faith. Secondly, in the iudgement, when we being inwardly conuinced, doe clearely reſolue that Chriſt is the way to bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and therefore the onely good tidings which our hearts can reſt vpon. This made the Apoſtle ſay,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Doubtleſſe I thinke</hi> (that is, this is my reſolute iudgement) <hi>that all things are loſſe and dung in reſpect of Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; when the greateſt care in vs is, (among other things) to lay vp the words of our bleſſed Sauiour,<note place="margin">Luk. Pſal. 119.</note> and to hide his promiſes in our hearts. Againe, faith muſt ſhew it ſelfe in the heart, when the heart beleeueth,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.9. Act. 8.39.</note> yea when wee beleeue with all our hearts: and this it doth in three things alſo. Firſt, in the appetite and deſires; when a man is ſo farre exerciſed in the ſpirituall ſeeking of Chriſt, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires rather to part with all the world if he had it, than not to haue ſome comfortable aſſurance of Gods loue in Ieſus Chriſt. And whoſoeuer ſhall thus ſell all to buy the pearle, hath true faith: for <hi>God heareth the deſires of the poore;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.17.</note> yet he heareth not to our comfort our prayers, except they be faithfull.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.6.</note> And <hi>they are bleſſed that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe;</hi> yet none are bleſſed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they who are of the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Secondly, in the affections; when the ſoule is confident, and reſteth vpon the promiſes of God in Chriſt, as the onely ground of happineſſe. For when there are no arguments drawne from a mans ſenſe and feeling, which may perſwade him of Gods loue in Chriſt, yet he doth confidently relie vpon it, then is he ſaid to <hi>liue by faith not by ſight,</hi> as <hi>Ioh</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that <hi>though God killed him, yet would he truſt in him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob.</note>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:479:130"/> Thus alſo doth faith quicken other affections, (as ioy, feare, loue, and the like) directing them to their right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and bringing them by degrees to this meaſure, that they are ſpent vpon Chriſt without meaſure. Thirdly, our faith doth ſhew it ſelfe in our wils; when the ſoule hauing many times a bleſſed experience of Gods loue is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it. Thus <hi>Pauls</hi> faith ſhewed it ſelfe, when he ſaid, <hi>I am perſwaded that neither life nor death</hi> (and ſo forth) <hi>ſhall ſeperate vs</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> me and other Chriſtians) <hi>from Gods loue which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Which perſwaſion (as I take it) doth more naturally belong vnto the will, it being more proper to the vnderſtanding to be conuicted, and to the will to be perſwaded. So that though the ſoule be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times toſſed with temptations, feares and terrours, yet more or leſſe it is much refreſhed with this perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how faith quickneth the whole ſoule of the godly man. In which reſpect if wee be quickned from the death of our vnderſtandings, and not of our deſires; if we perceiue the inliuing of our deſires, and not of our wils and affections, we haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect that we haue no faith. For faith is in no part of the ſoule in any meaſure, where it is not in all parts of the ſoule in ſome meaſure. For in this doth the life of the ſoule differ from the life of the bodie: that the life of the bodie doth begin in the heart, it being that which firſt liues, and doth end there, it being that which laſt dieth; but the life of the ſoule which can neuer periſh (though it may ſeeme not to worke for ſome time, like a member deaded with a blow) as it is in our firſt regeneration (like light in the aire) ſhed abroad thorow the whole ſoule; ſo it is alwaies to be found in all the powers of the ſoule, though in ſome man it be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the vnderſtanding, in ſome in the deſires, and in ſome others in the will and affections. Now therefore
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:479:130"/> let vs from hence-forth enter into our owne ſoules, to trie whether we haue faith yea or no. If we haue, it is our life, and if it be our life, it quickneth both our vnderſtandings to know Chriſt, our iudgements to approue him as our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sauiour and Redeemer, our memories to treaſure vp the promiſes, our deſires to haue an vnquenchable thirſt after him, our affections to be ſpent vpon him, our wils in ſome meaſure to be perſwaded of his loue to vs, and our whole ſoules to droope and mourne in our Chriſtian ioy, becauſe we cannot receiue him more fully in the whole to our end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, concerning others, we learne from this life of faith, who are the men that onely may be ſaid to liue: to wit, the godly man; becauſe he only hath faith. The great man liueth gallantly, the voluptuous man liueth merrily, the rich man wealthily, the politicke man warily, only the faithfull man liueth indeed, becauſe he liueth graciouſly. This is true life, and all other liues are deaths to this. The wealthie mans life is full of care, feare, griefe; but Faith triumpheth, That <hi>neither life nor death, principalitie nor power, things preſent nor things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> The poore mans life is full of diſcontent and penury; but Faith can want and abound, and in ſtead of other dainties doth euery day feed vpon Chriſt. The Infants life is full of mourning and crying; but Faith glads the heart in the midſt of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and makes it many times reioyce with ioy vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious. The young mans life is full of paſſion, wauering, and fickle inconſtancie; but Faith doth ſo bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace our ſoules, that we runne a ſetled courſe, and ſweare to keepe Gods righteous iudgements. The old mans life is full of deafeneſſe, dulneſſe, decayedneſſe; but Faith ſeeth thorow the clouds life in death, glory in ſhame, yea it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:479:131"/> the voice of God in euery ſentence, and though the outward man periſh, yet in the inner and hid man of the heart, Faith reneweth vs daily. Although therefore we muſt liue other liues both naturall and ciuill, yet let vs make more account of this, That <hi>Chriſt liueth in vs by faith,</hi> than of all other liues whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue I brought you along vnto the laſt thing which I ſhall obſerue from hence, that is, the exerciſe and expreſſement of that power which Faith giueth vs by our communion with Chriſt in a vertuous and holy life. For as hee hath ſaid, that wee haue fellowſhip in his death for our mortification; that we are quickned by faith in him for our viuification: ſo, that we, through that quickning power which wee doe receiue from Chriſt by faith, are made liuely vnto all holy obedience. Therefore is it that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is not I, but Christ that quickneth mee, concerning the life that we now liue, to liue graciouſly.</hi> Whence we muſt marke:
<q>That it is from the vertue and power of Chriſt, that wee are quickned to all holy obedience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we haue faith, yet we muſt not pride our ſelues in it; for it is not faith in it ſelfe that quickneth vs, but as it is a diuine power, whereby we doe receiue that life which is in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iohn 5.21.</note> Therefore is it ſaid, That <hi>the Sonne quickneth whom he will.</hi> Yea, and hence is it that the Scripture is ſo exact in ſetting downe our weakneſſe.

                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 12.</note> It is he that muſt admoniſh vs of that good which wee haue to doe,<note place="margin">Monendo, Movendo, Removendo.</note> that muſt ſtir vs vp to doe it, and that muſt remoue thoſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which hinder vs. Now why ſhould the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus anatomize the parts of our weakneſſe in good, but to teach vs that all our ſtrength and power is from Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Excellent alſo to this purpoſe is that Euangelicall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry: <hi>Hoe, euery one that thirſteth come ye to the waters,</hi>

                     <hi>and ye that haue no ſiluer come, buy, and eat; come I ſay, buy wine and milke without ſiluer and without money.</hi> Into which words if we pierce with a ſpirituall eye, we ſhall finde that they offer two things to be conſidered: A good turne from God, and a dutie from vs. In the firſt, hee doth firſt condition with the buyer, and hee doth allow or licenſe two ſorts to buy of him: <hi>Him that is thirſtie,</hi> that is, hee
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:479:132"/> that out of a ſight of Chriſts worth, and his owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe doth pant after Chriſt; <hi>and him that hath no ſiluer,</hi> that is, he that hath denied himſelfe, and in his owne eyes is nothing: ſecondly, hee doth make his offer; In which, firſt, he doth make knowne his ware-houſe, that is, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and thus much is implied in the nature of the words, which are a prophecie concerning Chriſt: ſecondly, hee offereth his ware vnder three words; <hi>water, milke,</hi> and <hi>wine;</hi> implying that in Chriſt is to bee found matters of conueniencie, neceſſitie, and delight: thirdly, hee pitcheth the price, and ſetteth it downe negatiuely, that God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an open houſe for <hi>beggars,</hi> and not a ſhop for buyers; he keepeth an hoſpitall not an ordinarie: for it commeth without ſiluer and without mony. Secondly, hee ſetteth downe a dutie from vs: for he telleth vs that if we be ſuch buyers and like the price, we muſt come, buy, and eat. So that in theſe words you may plainely perceiue that the Prophet doth cleerely ſet downe theſe two things. Firſt, that we haue nothing, wee are without ſpirituall ſiluer and money.<note place="margin">Phil.</note> Secondly, that Chriſt is <hi>all in all things</hi> vnto vs, and that <hi>God doth bleſſe vs with all ſpirituall bleſsings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things in Chriſt.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Oh that the conſideration of this point might thorowly enter into our ſoules! for we ſhall finde it both to be a ground of the deniall of our ſelues, and of attendance vpon Chriſt. Chriſt doth require that wee would denie
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:479:132"/> our ſelues, and follow him: and in this doctrine we haue a ground for both. Firſt, for deniall of our ſelues; who doth not denie himſelfe, and make himſelfe nothing in his owne eyes, when he duely conſiders that it is Chriſt who quickneth him? I know that naturally we haue a great deſire to haue ſome worth in our ſelues. <q rend="inline">I remember how it was with <hi>Alexander</hi> when he went into the <hi>Indies;</hi> hee cauſed horſe-ſhooes, and bitts of bridles, and ſpeares, and ſwords of an vnwonted bigneſſe to be left behinde him, and all becauſe men, that came thither in after-times, and ſhould heare that <hi>Alexander</hi> had beene there, might ſay, Surely <hi>Alexander</hi> was a mighty man indeed, a man of great power and worth:</q> right ſo is it with vs; we are ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe: we deſire with <hi>Saul, to be honoured before the people:</hi> we would faine be ſome bodie, or at leaſt we would be worth more than nothing. Hence doe come the diuiding conceits betweene God and mans will in the power of conuerſion, and betwixt faith and workes in the caſe of iuſtification. Hence alſo comes in the curſed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of merits (at the leaſt in the gratious works of Gods ſonnes) and of our being ſaued by our good beleefe to God-wards; by louing God aboue all, and our neighbours as our ſelues, and the like. But let vs neuer forget that Chriſt muſt increaſe, and we muſt decreaſe; that it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that <hi>liueth in vs</hi> (euen when we are at the beſt) and giueth vs all power, and that therefore we haue and are nothing: Chriſt neuer helpeth but in extreme need. As God dealt with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the red Sea, when the Sea was before them, the hill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vpon one hand, the ſea on the other, and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> behind them, then he ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Stretch out thy rod;</hi> and to the Sea, <hi>Stay thy proud waues, be made into walls for the defence of my people:</hi> ſo Chriſt when he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his diſciples to cry out, <hi>Saue Maſter, we periſh,</hi> then he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:479:133"/> rebukes the windes: when they cry out with <hi>Iehoſhaphat, Lord we know not what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee;</hi> when they haue no power, no worth in themſelues and their owne eyes, then he makes them <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> As therefore we loue our owne ſoules, as wee deſire to haue part and fellowſhip with Chriſt, to be made wiſe by his wiſdome, without guilt with his righteouſneſſe, without preuailing filth with his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and without apoſtacie with his redemption: ſo let vs be carefull to denie our ſelues, and lay downe at his feet the crowne of our glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for attendance: who will not follow Chriſt, who is ſuch a bountifull maſter, that hee putteth new life into all his followers? No great men need ſue for atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; yet their followers many times are compared to faſting daies, which are next vnto holy-daies, but otherwiſe they are the leaneſt daies in all the weeke: much leſſe need thoſe honourable maſters ſue for any, who doe moſt for their ſeruitours, they ſhall haue offerers good ſtore. And ſhall it be otherwiſe with Chriſt? Shall ſuch a maſter want followers,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> who calleth out vnto vs, <hi>Come vnto me all yee that are weary and heauy laden, and I will refreſh you?</hi> Oh what an argument is this that we feele not the want of Chriſt and his ſocietie! It may be you will ſay, that Chriſt indeed claddeth you with mourning and perſecution: and is he alſo the fountaine of life and holineſſe to them that come vnto him? Yea verily: As <hi>Adams</hi> vnrighteouſneſſe and vnholineſſe is the fountaine of our guilt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo Chriſts righteouſneſſe and holineſſe is not onely the matter of our righteouſneſſe, but the root of our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification alſo. By faith we are vnited vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and ingraffed into him, and as the root doth ſend vp iuyce into the branches; ſo doth Chriſt ſhoot in diuine ſpirits,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:479:133"/> and infuſe holineſſe into his members. But, ſaith the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, I haue beleeued in Chriſt, yet I finde not my bloudy iſſue of ſinne to be ſtaied with this touch. Liſten therefore a while. It is poſſible for vs to haue ſpirituall life, and not to diſcerne it. And if yet further thou doe inquire, how this our communion with Chriſt may ſo be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that we may finde life deriued into our ſoules from our ſpirituall touch of Chriſt? I anſwer: In the vſe of three ordinarie meanes of ſaluation. Firſt, in prayer: <hi>Aske and I will giue.</hi> If the ſpirit of ſupplication commeth once, then as it bindeth Gods hands, as when God ſaid, <hi>Now Moſes let me alone;</hi> ſo it openeth Gods hands, as <hi>Elias</hi> did when he obtained ſhowres; yea and openeth all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges betwixt Chriſt our head and vs his members, whereby ſpirituall life is deriued into vs. Which of Gods children haue not felt ſinne ſtabbed and dying in this dutie, and Chriſt liuing to controll ſinne, and to comfort vs againſt all diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the word of God preached: <hi>Heare and your ſoules ſhall liue.</hi> Where is he who hath heard of conſcience, and not of cuſtome, who hath not found Chriſt in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie laſhing the ſeared conſcience, quickning the dead affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, inclining the rebellious will, and drawing out reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions from the whole man to follow Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Sacrament: the bread and cup is the ſpirituall communion of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt. What faithfull man hath not felt Chriſt caſt an inward ſhame vpon the ſoule for entertaining him into ſo foule an houſe? Yea, and how eaſie is it in that ſeale of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to finde him pricking the ſoule for ſinne paſt, and ſtrengthning the weake hands of faith againſt ſin to come? As thou wouldſt haue comfort to thy ſoule, mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> how Chriſt deriueth holineſſe in theſe meanes of ſaluation, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:479:134"/> thou maiſt finde it drop by experience, that ſo thou, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him to be ſuch a fountaine opened to the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> for ſinne and for vncleanneſſe, maiſt runne vnto him for cleanneſſe, and follow after for comfort and ſtabilitie in all thy courſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus we haue conſidered our miſerie to lament it, and our deliuerance to worke in vs thankfull hearts. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iewes vowed, <hi>If I forget thee, ô Ieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning:</hi> ſo with an humble reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (depending vpon the power of Chriſt for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance) let vs determine to write Chriſt in red letters in the tables of our hearts, and neuer forget him to be the well-ſpring of life and holineſſe, that all things may be loſſe and dung vnto vs in reſpect of that treaſure which is in him to our endleſſe ioy.</p>

Bookes were neuer more plentifull; as knowledge, they doe abound as waters of the Sea: yet there was neuer more need of good ones, as being one ſpeciall meanes to pull downe ſinne and Antichriſt. I cannot commend mine to be ſuch: yet, as Gods gifts, I can commend my deſires to be forward (as I am able) to doe God ſeruice both by tongue and pen. I ſee the iustice of God giuing ouer ſome, who had no loue to the truth, to beleeue the lies of the Man of Sinne. And God hauing made me a poore Watchman in his Church, I would willingly warne mine owne ſheepe of the danger, both by word and writing; yet, before it goeth to others, it doth come vnto you both, acknowledging your furtherances of it, and crauing your fauours both to entertaine and vſe it as your owne. We poore Schollers doe wearie our bodies many waies: by writing amongst the reſt. But a valiant man will not ſtand vpon the breach of his weapon, ſo he may get the victorie: nor we vpon the wearying and wearing of our bodies, if we may gaine what we fight for, to wit, the acceptance of our labours by them to whom wee doe intend them, together with the ſaluation of their ſoules. How-euer the ſucceſſe may be, my hope ſhall lift vp my head amid all my faintings. Neither doe I feare, but that good people will giue approbation to what I haue rather la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to doe, than done. My aime is but to ſtriue for Religion, and for that Religion which will giue vs comfort before God. I haue conſidered many times the danger of Idolatrie: as firſt, that Idolaters are a ſottiſh people, who, through Gods iuſt iudgement,<note place="margin">Eſay 46.6, 7, 8. Eſay. 54.9, &amp;c.</note> withhold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe, and will not walke in the light of reaſon. Secondly, that they are a cruell people,<note place="margin">Dan 3.</note> like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who garded his Idoll with a fiery fornace, <hi>and heat it ſeuen times hotter for the true worſhippers of God;</hi> and like the ancient perſecutors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, who put <hi>Chriſtians</hi> vpon croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſtakes, who did teare and ſcratch their ſides with nailes
<pb facs="tcp:479:136"/> and clawes, who cast them vnto beaſts, and burnt and broyled them with fire, and the like. Thirdly, that they are an alluring people, who haue their vermilion Images, like thoſe that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ieruſhalem,</hi> and their great rewards like the Deuill,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note>

Firſt, the plaine and powerfull deliuerie of the myſteries of Faith, both by word and writing, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſo both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be brought to embrace them. Secondly, the plaine and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:479:139"/> expreſſing and preſſing of the <hi>obedience of Faith,</hi> and ſuch a life as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>In both theſe kindes <hi>Paul</hi> was excellent: but in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was more briefe thorow all his Epiſtles. The other Apoſtles were more briefe in the doctrine of Faith, and in the duties of Chriſtian profeſſion more large and plentiful. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> principally laboureth for pietie, patience, and conſtancie againſt falſe apoſtles. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for the loue of God and of the Saints. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> againſt falſe teachers and hypocrites. And this our Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> laboureth for patience vnder the Croſſe and a Chriſtian life. In the performance whereof (as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uines doe well agree) wee meet with ſomething which doth not occurre in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the other Apoſtles. None doth ſo clearely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the cauſe of ſinne: the neceſſary iſſue of workes from iuſtifying faith: the concatenation and vnion of the whole Law: the imperfection of humane righteouſneſſe from the miſcariage of the tongue: our dependance vpon the prouidence of God euen in ciuill things: and the carriage of ſicke perſons in thoſe miraculous times. In theſe points (I ſay) this Apoſtle carrieth away the bell from the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The principall point in this Epiſtle doth ſeeme to be this: <hi>That with the faith of Chriſt Chriſtian workes are to be ioyned:</hi> Wherein we muſt walke to the end of our Faith, which is the ſaluation of our ſoules. The principall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereby he vrgeth it, is this: becauſe the faith of Chriſt (which in ſecuritanes is falſely ſo called) without Chriſtian life is but a dead carkaſſe or vaine ſhadow of faith, and not a liuing faith, or that Spirit of Faith, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of. Hence therefore doth he take occaſion to vrge to diuers parts of Chriſtian life and good conuerſation. In this Chapter he treateth of three points. Firſt, of the temptations of Chriſtians, both outward by afflictions,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:479:139"/> and inward by luſts: Secondly, of the hearing and doing of the Word of God: and thirdly, in the two laſt verſes, of true and falſe religion. In the firſt of which hee ſhewes what religion is in vaine: in the ſecond of which he ſhewes what religion will beare the touch and triall.</p>
                  <p>Wee haue to doe with the ſecond at this time: wherein religion is deſcribed; Firſt, by the affections, properties, or adiuncts of it, when it is ſaid to be <hi>pure and vndefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God:</hi> And ſecondly, by the fruits and effects of it; and thoſe both towards others, while it workes vs to viſit <hi>the fatherleſſe and widowes in aduerſitie,</hi> as alſo in our ſelues who haue it, while it workes vs to keepe our ſelues <hi>vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conceiue aright of theſe things, for our further vſe and benefit, I muſt open vnto you, Firſt, the thing ſpoken of; and ſecondly, that which is ſpoken of it.

                     </label> It is true, that the Apoſtle deſcribes it not by the intrinſicall forme and eſſence of it, but by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badges and markes whereby it is diſcouered. Hee knew well enough that euery one that profeſſeth religion will be apt to boaſt of theſe things: concerning which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in the heart, euery hypocrite may goe away with his owne brag without controll: therefore as it was with the Pſalmiſt, when he asked who was a true member of the Church vpon earth, and who ſhould goe to heauen?<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> hee giueth almoſt all outward notes drawne from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, which fall into other mens apprehenſions: euen ſo it is with our bleſſed Apoſtle; he giueth viſible and palpable notes of religion, which doe occurre to the ſenſes of ordinary men, and are the recognizances of pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                     <note place="margin">We muſt haue a religion.</note>As to the firſt point: We may be ſure of this, that God would not learne vs to know religion, if he did not withall require that wee ſhould be of it. In that therefore he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it out, he doth imply that we muſt haue it, to profeſſe and cleaue vnto both in life and death, and to try the truth of it by theſe notes which God offereth. To preſſe then the hauing of a religion vnto vs, doe but conſider three grounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Religion is that which aſſureth our hearts, that we haue right in God and Chriſt, and ſo are the temples of the holy Ghoſt, Chriſts members, and Gods children, who may expect maintenance from him. Who haue right in a King, but they who are knit vnto him by ſubiection and loyaltie? So none but they who are knit vnto God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, can ſay that they haue either right in God, or in the things of God. He that is <hi>without God and without Chriſt,</hi> (as if hee ſhould ſay, without religion) <hi>is an aliant from the common-wealth of Iſrael,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Religion is that which is the mother of all diuine vertue, whereby we are made like vnto God. <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames</hi> here) <hi>will make vs doe good to others and preſerue our ſelues.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 1.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The feare of God</hi> (that is, religion) <hi>is the beginning of wiſdome.</hi> The religious Proſelites followed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for heauenly inſtructions:<note place="margin">Act. 13.43.</note> The religion of <hi>Daniel</hi> made him to <hi>determine in his heart that hee would not defile himſelfe with the Kings meat:</hi>

                     <hi>Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> made them to refuſe to bowe to that accurſed Idol; And the religion of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> preſerued him from vnchaſtitie, and made him ſwallow downe (as it were) without ſenſe the vnkindneſſes of his brethren:<note place="margin">Gen. 50.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Feare not</hi> (ſaith he to his timorous brethren) <hi>am I in Gods ſtead, to take vengeance out of his hand? or am

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Where there is no religion, there can bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but licentiouſneſſe and diſorder: all the wickedneſſe of men, who goe ſhrowded vnder the religious title of Chriſtians, is practiſed by them for want of religion. So profeſſed Atheiſts (if it were poſſible that they ſhould be ſuch at all times) doe commit all their outrages for want of religion: and for want of religion is it alſo that they <hi>who profeſſe they know God, but by workes deny him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>are abhominable and diſobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.</hi> As without a counterfeit religion, there could bee no ciuill vertue (in which reſpect they who knew not the true God would ſtill faine a religion to reſtrain nature:) ſo without the true religion there will be nothing but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured vertue or outragious vice. In the old world religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was corrupted, and therefore it was no wonder, that <hi>the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw that in the court of <hi>Abimelech</hi> there was no <hi>feare of God,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.11.</note> no true religion, and therefore he thought iuſtly that they would ſlay him for his wiues ſake.

                  <p>Seeing therefore, that religion doth aſſure our hearts of our right in Chriſt, doth breed vertue, and in the abſence of it doth leaue a fearefull gap for all impietie; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we ſhould haue a religion.</p>

                     <hi>and deuilliſh,</hi> we ſee too many men to cleaue vnto vaine vanities, &amp; ſo to <hi>forſake their owne mercy:</hi> Yea, ſeeing we ſee a world of men lie in wickednes, as it were drowned in the dregs of impietie; it is euident that they are not tied vnto God by religion who would pull them another way. Secondly, they who are knit to God by religion, will with carefull hearts pray to God that he would neuer cut the cord aſunder, nor euer let goe his hold, but that he would euer goe with them, &amp; ſupport them from falling into any miſerie. We haue had experience of our danger when we were knit vnto the world &amp; the fleſh: and therefore finding a better and more comfortable band, we will deſire it may neuer be cracked. As he that hangeth by a rope fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an high Tower, or ouer a Well, knowing himſelfe to be at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of him that holdeth it, will cry to him, and intreat him earneſtly to hold faſt: ſo they, who are vnited vnto God by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:479:142"/> religion, and ſee their danger if he let goe, will neuer giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to pray, that he will be intreated for euer to take ſuch hold of them, that they may with <hi>Cornelius</hi> be <hi>deuout men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10.2.</note> and <hi>religious,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 13.43, 50.</note> as thoſe proſelytes &amp; honourable women are called. Seeing therfore that this heauenly dutie of prayer is ſo much neglected, and for the moſt part turned into a lip-labour, and degenerated from the worke of the heart to the worke of the knowing head, and voluble tongue: it is a ſigne that many and many are not knit to God by religion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider that the religion of many doth not proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eſtabliſhment of Gods <hi>free ſpirit:</hi> and ſo,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.12.</note> it not being free, is as none in truth. Like the mony-changers of old, many come to the Temple,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> rather to ſell doues than to ſerue God. Many (I ſay) ſeeme to be religious, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might gaine by others (as that Pope, who in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>S. Peter</hi> dined vpon a net till hee had caught the Popedome,) or at the leaſt becauſe they would not loſe (as thoſe who ioyne themſelues to the aſſemblies of the Saints for feare of penalties.) Theſe are like thoſe who ſought Chriſt, <hi>not becauſe they ſaw the miracles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>but becauſe they ate &amp; were ſatisfied.</hi> The Deuil may iuſtly faſten his vniuſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iob</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch, that <hi>they feare not God,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Iob 1.9.</note> that they are not religious for nothing. In which reſpect ſuch may iuſtly doubt that they haue as yet no religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay then? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Vſe."/> I deſire to exhort euery one of vs to be of a religion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.13.</note> and to giue our names to God for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie or willing ſeruice. All the while we are out of this knot, we are a prey to the Deuill, and are ready to be wound about the finger of euery ſeducer, and to be blowne about with euery winde of doctrine. For whence is it that men either alter their religion, or ſtubbornly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their falſe religion, but in part becauſe they haue no religion at all as they ſhould? <hi>They went out from vs,</hi> (ſaith

                     <hi>Iohn) but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would haue continued with vs.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay; If theſe limmes of the ſeducing Antichriſts had euer had true religion, they would not haue forſaken the fellowſhip of the Church and communion of the Saints. To preuent this therefore we muſt be exhorted to haue a religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What we muſt doe to haue a religion.</note>But you will aske me: What muſt we doe that wee may haue a religion? I anſwer: firſt, we muſt conſider, that by nature, as we are in the loynes of ſinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with his guilt and filth, we are of the Deuils religion, euen <hi>children of wrath.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> And though, through Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and appointment, we doe receiue an outward <hi>ſigne and ſeale</hi> of the Chriſtian religion in Baptiſme;<note place="margin">Rom 4.11.</note> yet ſo ſoone as euer we come to crawle, we are ſo prone to euill, and ſo backward vnto good, as if we loued the Deuils reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion beſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt ſee this our miſerable eſtate, be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, and deſire to enter into couenant with God, that he may be our God and we his people. This is called, <hi>a bringing againe vnto the Lord:</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34.3.</note> And this example ought to be a monitor from generation to generation of what euery one of vs ought to doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt with care and conſcience attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meanes of ſaluation, as they are offered vnto vs in the miniſtery of the Church of God; that ſo wee may know the vertues and powers of this couenant to doe thereafter.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.24.</note> For though wee haue no dominion ouer your faith (in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, we muſt openly profeſſe our ſelues to be in couenant with God.<note place="margin">Titus 1.1.</note> This the Apoſtle calleth an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the truth, which is according to godlineſſe: and euery one of vs muſt labour for it, both by encreaſing our knowledge in the things of God, as alſo by labouring for a good and a godly life, and preparing our ſelues to <hi>giue a reaſon of the hope that is in vs,</hi>

                     <hi>yet wee haue need againe to be taught the firſt principles of the word of God; and are become ſuch as haue need of milke, and not of ſtrong meat:</hi> yet, for all that, wee muſt aime at, and ſtriue that through long cuſtome, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, meditation, and conference,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.14.</note> we <hi>may haue our wits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to diſcerne both good and euill,</hi> that ſo wee may with more boldneſſe appeare before the greateſt enemies of truth and profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, we muſt renue our couenant with God in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper ſo often as conueniently we can: and with feare and trembling deſire God to aſſure vnto vs the comforts of the Goſpell, according to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of our hearts. Yee know that Sacraments are called ſeales: and the reaſon is, becauſe in their lawfull and holy vſe they haue a confirming, conueying and concluding nature. They doe confirme, becauſe they doe as pledges viſibly ſtrengthen our faith in the promiſes. They doe conuey, becauſe as written inſtruments by the ordinations
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:479:144"/> of Princes are conueyances of houſes, and lands, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances vnto vs, though we are many miles from them: ſo by the ordination of God the Sacraments are no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but voluntary inſtruments to ſettle and aſſure Ieſus Chriſt vpon and vnto vs (being fitly prepared according to his will) though he be aſcended into heauen, and ſits at the right hand of God: They doe conclude, becauſe, as ſealing and deliuering is the latter end of a bargaine, and doth ſhut it vp, ſo the Sacraments doe conclude and ſhut vp the couenant betweene God and vs, to our endleſſe comforts; if, according to thoſe abilities which God hath vouchſafed vnto vs, we keepe touch with him.

                  <p>Thus I haue taught you what wee muſt doe to haue a religion. But yet we are not the nearer to God, if wee be not of that religion which is pleaſing to him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt now leaue this point, and paſſe along to the next.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond ground then to bee conſidered is this: That</p>

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:479:144"/>
                  <p>For this is the reaſon that this Religion,<note place="margin">We muſt haue that Religion which doth moſt approue it ſelfe vnto God.</note> which we muſt haue, is deſcribed to be pure and vndefiled before God: thereby implying that the true Religion doth moſt labour for that.

If true religion haue golden Prieſts and woodden Chalices; falſe religion will haue with woodden Prieſts golden Chalices. Let true religion haue a ſacrifice of beaſts; the falſe will haue a ſacrifice of men. If the true haue waſhings; the falſe will haue abundance

                  <p>Thus let vs carry with vs theſe foure meditations, and conclude from them thus much: that ſeeing the religion of hypocrites and wicked men may equall, and falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may imitate and outſtrip the true religion in ſhewes: therefore we muſt iudge righteous iudgement: wee muſt not chuſe religion according to appearance and ſhewes, but ſtriue to be of that which doth moſt approue it ſelfe to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Vſe."/> What vſe ſhall we make of this point now but this, to learne to cleaue to that religion which we ſhall finde to be more in heart than in ſhew.

They haue muſicke and chaunting for the eare, without the exerciſe either of vnderſtanding or heart. They haue golden and veluet, ſilken and taffatie Images for the eye. They haue Incenſe or other ſweet perfumes for the noſe. They haue iuncates and banquets on their falſly called faſting daies for their pallates, though they will not ordinarily eat fleſh on Fridaies. And that the wiſe men of the world may be led vp and downe, as men without wit, by the noſe, they haue a glorious Latine ſeruice in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, though it be impoſſible for him that hath the roome of the vnlearned to ſuch a ſeruice to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>

I will ſay but three things more, and ſo I ſhall paſſe to the next ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a bulruſh is greene and ſmooth, he is curious to a miracle that can finde a knot in it; yet within, it hath but a vſeleſſe and ſpongie pith in it; in which reſpect God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth <hi>hypocriticall faſters</hi> to ſuch.<note place="margin">Eſ. 58.5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the harlot goeth beyond the modeſt woman in gariſh attire, yea ſhee will make ſuch ſhewes as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt woman ſhames. Her <hi>adorning is not outward, but in the hid man of the heart.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3, 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Deuill finding that of all the ſenſes the eye is the fitteſt for the working of his proiects, he doth vſe it much. <hi>Euah</hi> ſaw that the tree was good for meat, and ſhee tooke it and did eat. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and you know what followeth. <hi>Ieruſhalem</hi> ſaw vermilion Images, and ſhe affected them. God doth vſually call vs vnto him by
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:479:148"/> the eare: hee that deſireth to lodge among the wiſe, muſt prepare his <hi>Eare to hearken to the inſtruction of life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 15.31.</note> But the Deuill doth vſually call men by the eye: it is the eye which is his ordinary broker, and ſtrikes the bargaine for him.</p>
                  <p>My concluſion is this: that ſeeing faire ſhewes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be without ſinceritie, and that thoſe may make greater ſhewes than ordinarie, who are furtheſt from God, and that yet the Deuill doth ſeeke to abuſe vs, and draw vs to his part by ſhewes: wee muſt not chooſe our religion by ſhewes, but cleaue vnto our owne which we ſhall finde moſt to approue it ſelfe to God.</p>
                  <p>The third ground whereto the doctrine of this Text is referred, is this: that
<q>True Religion is a mercifull Religion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It maketh vs (ſaith <hi>Iames</hi> here) <hi>to viſit the fatherleſſe and widowes in their aduerſities.</hi> Religion is (as it were) an order and ſeruice <hi>after Gods owne heart,</hi> who is a God of loue and mercie. When God promiſeth to giue his people Prieſts who ſhould pitie them and haue a mercifull care of them, he calleth them <hi>Prieſts after his owne heart,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ierem.</note> who ſhall be mercifull as he is mercifull. Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being an iſſue of Gods will and nature, it muſt needs ſauour of mercie and compaſſion. Againe, the fruits of Religion are <hi>Loue, Ioy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galath. 5.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> which all are either mother, daughter, members or companions of that which wee call <hi>Mercie.</hi> And how can Religion be other, which is the exerciſe of a mother? The Church is called the <hi>Mother of vs all:</hi> and we know,<note place="margin">Galath. 4.</note> from that ancient iudgement of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that ſhee who had moſt affection to the childe, was the true mother, that the exerciſe of a mother is mercie.</p>
                  <p>Now, from this ground I would inforce two things: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, that euery one of vs muſt ſtriue to be mercifull, as
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:479:149"/> our heauenly Father is mercifull. This is that which will aſſure vs that we are truly religious. No mercie, no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God is immediatly mercifull to vs himſelfe, when he ſends his Spirit into our hearts to teach vs, correct, and comfort vs according to our neceſſities: and hee maketh all the creatures of heauen and earth to be liberall vnto vs, and helpfull in ſome kinde or other; and all to this end, that we being knit vnto him by true religion, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to be mercifull alſo: yea, we muſt be ſo euen vnto the enemies of religion. We ſee many times that no ciuill cauſe maketh a more ſeuere and cruel warre than Religion doth. When the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and <hi>Manaſsites</hi> had ſet vp an Altar by Iordan, their brethren, thinking that it had beene to ſeparate religion, preſently muſtered their forces againſt them. The Iewes and Samaritanes being of diuers religions, euen <hi>Peter</hi> could ſmell of this naturall crueltie, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, call for fire from heauen to conſume the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes:</hi> but Chriſt cruſhed it, ſaying, <hi>Yee know not of what Spirit you are.</hi> Yea ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of them who ſhall take his Diſciples to taske for religion ſake, <hi>They ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate you, and kill you,</hi> and in ſo doing they ſhall thinke that they doe God good ſeruice. But we muſt ſtriue againſt this crueltie, and exerciſe mercie as the proper fruit of religion.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhall beleeue the declamations of the Ieſuits, they will tell vs that yet wee are not mercifull: and therefore they crie out againſt our crueltie exerciſed vpon the <hi>Pope-holy Catholikes,</hi> in tearing, chopping and burning of them, together with the making of their members a prey to the fowles of heauen, and the like. Is this mercie, ſay they? No ſurely, as it is barely looked vpon, without ſearching into the cauſe. Yet when wee doe ſee many knowne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the Land, and none capitally puniſhed but Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:479:149"/> and when we doe ſee that ſuch are puniſhed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than traytours were puniſhed when <hi>Popery</hi> vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon vs: and when withall we doe conſider, that we haue no law to put any Papiſt to death for his conſcience ſake; or if wee haue a law in that ancient Statute of their owne, concerning the burning of Heretikes, by vertue whereof they conſumed vs; that yet none of their bodies euer felt thoſe flames: when we doe ſee (I ſay) and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things, we do reioice in our religion, finding mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in it; and doe encourage our ſelues to goe on ſtill, both to proceed mildly againſt them, to pitie, and to pray for them, and by walking holily before them, to trie if yet God will haue mercie on them, and bring them to know the Truth.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, Wee learne alſo from the former ground, that wee haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect that the religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Religion. We know that <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpirituall <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11.</note> and that ſhee letteth the corpſes of the Saints lie dead in the ſtreets: We ſee that her inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fire and ſword, and that her meanes are power and policie, by hooke and crooke, as we ſay. Euery time the fifth of <hi>Nouember</hi> returneth, it calleth to our minde enough of this kinde, if we could forget the <hi>Popes</hi> practiſes againſt the Emperours. We know that their partie would haue deſtroyed our whole State (euen the breath of our noſtrils and creame of our Land) at one blow. Wee ſee alſo (ſo farre as their cloſe policie will giue vs leaue) the crueltie of their Inquiſitions. They aske vs where is our religion ſaue in little nookes and corners of the world?

For firſt, plenty of all things is giuen to godleſſe perſons.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.3, 4, 5.</note> It was <hi>Dauids</hi> temptation, that the fooliſh had <hi>no bands in their death, but were luſtie and ſtrong, and were not in trouble like others, neither plagued like other men.</hi> It was <hi>Iobs</hi> trouble,<note place="margin">Iob 21.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> that <hi>the wicked did grow in wealth, that their houſes were peaceable without feare, that their bullocke gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and failed not, that they ſent forth their children like ſheepe</hi> (well clad) <hi>and their ſonnes danced,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, greater plenty may be in the times of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie than when true Religion is practiſed and embraced. Neuer forget that of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie:</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, they who are void of loue may be good houſe-keepers and liberall perſons. This <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to imply when he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3.</note>

                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:479:151"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may not wonder that there ſhould be worſe houſe-keeping now than in former times of Idolatry. For the poore receiue the Goſpell, and the things of this world, which are the matter of hoſpitalitie, are more generally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as the rewards of this life, to them that haue no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a reward in heauen. There are many conuinced of the truth of the Goſpell, but few are conuerted, and ſo they are not filled with mercy and compaſſion as they ſhould be. And yet wee are not to blame our religion, which is mercifull, but ſuch hard-hearted perſons, that doe not make that vſe of it which they ſhould; but had rather ſpend their eſtates in gariſh pompe, pride, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, than in releeuing the Saints of God. Loe thus doth it ſtill ſtand good, that our Religion rather than Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie hath this marke of mercy vpon it, notwithſtanding theſe ſhewes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ground which I propounded to be conſidered from hence is this, that
<q>Pure religion will keepe vs from open and profeſſed tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> This is that which the Apoſtle implieth, when he ſaith, that it <hi>keeps our ſelues vnſpotted of the world;</hi> to wit, if wee hearken, and yeeld vnto it, for the ruling of our hearts. For otherwiſe it will doe vs no more good than phyſick, which is preſently vomited vp againe.

                     </label> To this I anſwer three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is true that where God ſoweth his ſeed, the deuill that euill one ſoweth tares. For beſides his malice to good, he ſeeks to diſgrace the generation of the iuſt ſo much as poſſibly he can. Hee knew what line Ieſus Chriſt ſhould come of, and therefore we ſee what blots he threw in the way, in <hi>Dauid, Iudah, Tamar,</hi> and the like. Yea in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as ſometimes he hath drawne profeſſors of religion by his cunning ſophiſtry to be fearefully ſcandalous in the way of God, to the wounding of their ſoules: ſo he hath thruſt in hypocrites amongſt them (ſuch as <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>) who, for ſiniſter reſpects of profit, glory, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:479:152"/> and the like, haue made ſhew of godlineſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though wickedneſſe may be found amongſt them who profeſſe themſelues to be of the true Church, yet not to be defended, (for curſed be ſuch members.) There may be controuertible things, which ſeeme to be ſinnes to ſome, and to others not ſo, which may finde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences on both ſides: but none which are clearely iudged to be ſo by all ſound members of the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">In vera eccleſia peccatum cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatione &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatione: in falſa cum excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione &amp; defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> there may be ſinne in the true Church with the griefe, reproofe, and amendment of the true members of it: whereas in a falſe Church it domineereth with excuſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and approbation.</p>
                  <p>How ſhould I now apply this point, but firſt vnto our ſelues, and ſecondly to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>

So neither will pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if it doe not dwell in vs for our amendment.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, that as there were three parts of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple; the outer Court, the Holy place, and the Holy of Holies: ſo, like to theſe, there is a three-fold holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe corruptly ſo accounted.

                  <p>Thus I haue ſhewed you that the Romiſh religion is not the true, becauſe it keepes not her profeſſors from the ſpots of the world. I know (as they ſay) that there are many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all ſtates, and that God hath no wheat field in this world, where the deuill hath no tares growing: but for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to ariſe out of the doctrine that is taught, and out of the profeſſion of it, is a certaine ſigne of no pure religion. Oh therefore, as the wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, ſo let vs. Let vs ſee the impuritie of their profeſſion: and as wee loue our ſoules, let vs take heed of their <hi>myſterie of iniquitie in a golden cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might alſo ſhew you how they ſin againſt the beleefe by their high Prieſt and King the Pope, multitude of mediators, merits, Catholike particular Church, Iuſtification, Prieſtly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute abſolution, and the like: ſo alſo how they ſin againſt the Lords praier, by inuocation of Saints, implicite faith, freewill, merit of workes, and the like: ſo likewiſe againſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by humane mixtures, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſence, and ſo adoration. But it will be enough to an honeſt heart to ſee day at a little hole, and to learne by the paw to know and hate the whole bodie of Popery.</p>
                  <p>To end in a word therefore: I haue taught you to haue a religion, and to haue that religion which doth moſt approue it ſelfe to God. I pray God therefore that we may be wiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it by the mercifulneſſe of it, and by its freedome from ſpots, that we, renouncing all falſe religions &amp; worſhips, may cleaue vnto God the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in him ours, euen in truth and faithfulneſſe: Euen ſo, <hi>Amen.</hi>
